`steam_games_enhanced.zip` contains the output csv file of the previous folder (`1 merging_datasets`). Such file is then processed in the `steam_games_data_preparation.ipynb` notebook. Some attributes were updated by scraping from `Backloggd` (the results of the scraping are contained into `backloggd_contatori.csv`), from `SteamChart` (the results of the scraping are contained into `steam_peak_all.csv`) and from `Metacritic` (the results of the scraping are contained into `user_score_updated.csv`).
The script `data_type_fix.py` was written to handle efficiently the various data types in the dataset.
