`merging_datasets.ipynb` puts together some datasets in order to have a more rich dataset to work with. In particular the datasets considered are the following: [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset), [Steam Trends 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5MErWbFJ2Gsde9QxJ_HNMltKfF6fHCYdv4OQpXdnZ4/edit?gid=1714749788#gid=1714749788), [Video Games Sales 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/video-game-sales-2024), [Popular Video Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matheusfonsecachaves/popular-video-games/data), [MetaCritic Game Score Scrape](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikkelbjohansen/metacritic-game-score-scrape-2024-13301-rows).
Some of the attributes in the data were then updated using the SteamSpy API.
