"17ku4k7","k79xh91","tldr; The article discusses the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 2. The speculation arises from the SEC's decision not to contest the US Court of Appeals' judgment in favor of Grayscale's bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. A closed-door meeting is scheduled for November 2, where the SEC will discuss the resolution of litigation claims and administrative proceedings. The Bitcoin community is closely watching this scenario, especially after the successful launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The article also mentions the possibility of leaks and the question of whether the SEC will approve only Grayscale or all applicants simultaneously. The SEC has received numerous amendments from other applicants, indicating progress towards approval. However, there are speculations that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler might unexpectedly reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The article concludes by mentioning the current price of Bitcoin.

I slapped this baby together ASAP because it was submitted late so don’t go fact checking everything lol. Thanks Michael Saylor’s twitter, my only reference used.

**The Architecture of Money**

These diagrams and text analyze the concept behind a monetary medium of exchange,and how architecture and the built environment is affected by the various types of money used throughout history, particularly Gold, the US Dollar, and Bitcoin. Much like architecture, the use and purpose for a monetary medium of exchange has evolved overtime due to the external effects of globalization, and the advances in technology it brought. To better help compare the various types of money as it relates to the built environment, we must think of money as energy. The purpose of money is for the fair exchange of value from one party to another. The simplest way to ensure an exchange of value remains fair is by using an identical monetary medium of exchange, therefore equal in the same quantity. There have been many types of money throughout the course of modern history, but for the purposes of this study, we will focus on three: Gold, the traditional and most valuable medium of exchange ($12.19 trillion market cap), the US Dollar (world reserve currency), and a newer form of value exchange through cryptographic technology, Bitcoin (BTC). A monetary medium of exchange can be described as energy through the various ways in which the value is acquired, produced, transported, or traded. Whether it’s the mining operations, transportation, and production required to bring Gold to a workable format, the global resource, economic, and military advantage required by the US Dollar, or the technology requirements in the form of a computer with an internet connection for Bitcoin, each of the ways the world opts to exchange value, all require the use of energy. The diagrams seek to illustrate different aspects of monetary exchange at three contrasting scales: micro, national, and global.The micro scale primarily explores the comparison of transaction validity andconfirmation through the traditional financial sector (US Dollar, fiat currency), and thecryptographic financial sector (Bitcoin, cryptocurrency). This comparison is overlayed andexpressed through the silicon network map of a graphics card (GPU), the necessary computercomponent behind the resource extraction of Bitcoin (bitcoin mining). The second diagramlooks at the powerful physical prominence of legacy financial institutions in Canada, and howusers exchange value using the Canadian Dollar (CAD), and diagram three paints a simplifiedpicture of the reach and implications of three monetary networks at a global scale (Gold, USDollar, Bitcoin).","heyzeushimseIf"
"17krhzl","k79eyaw","Money, in the traditional sense, is the resource and tool for navigating one’s life. The prerequisite avenue for the symbolic depiction of a home, in the social representation of a hierarchy of status (Aureli, and Giudici, 2016). The marginalization of lower social classes and the monopolization of power can be linked to the demise of the feudal system and the increasing rise in wage labour. Karl Marx describes this intention as ‘primitive accumulation’, “the systematic construction of a class deprived of the control of their means of production through institutionalized theft and violence. This violence was perpetrated by enclosing the commons,privatizing resources, and driving dispossessed people to urban centers where they would have only their own labor power to sell.” (Aureli, and Giudici, 2016). One of aspects of the resource privatization today can be expressed through the World’s centralized monetary networks (central banks), which removes full monetary control of the user (average citizen). National governments and institutions maintain full power over the currency, increasing and decreasing the money supply as they see necessary. These adjustments to the rate of inflation are not typically done in the favour of poor and working-class people, and in more recent times, middle-class people as well. A continuation in the demise of a deprived late-stage capitalist society.The emergence of a fifth industrial revolution is upon us, bringing the rapid restructuring of an interconnected and globalized world, and the ways in which it operates. Architecture as a profession is no stranger to restructuring. The profession itself and the role of the architect has evolved many times throughout history as a result of the extreme economic shifts and technological advancements made through industrial exploration and discovery. JesseLeCavalier speaks to the use of architecture as a means of leverage and territorial control in “The Rule of Logistics: Walmart and the Architecture of Fulfillment”. The text explores logistical innovations in the efficient operation of functional architectural form. Maintaining regional control of power through the occupation of physical land and the benefit of increased economic activity by incorporating designs that remove the human conscious (LeCavalier, 2017). In the case of a monetary medium of exchange, the second diagram illustrates the architectural dominance of legacy financial institutions in Canada. Most notably, their physical prominence in urban centres and the centralized monetary network they facilitate and support.Are there positive implications in the hypothetical adoption of Bitcoin as a decentralized medium of exchange? Much has been said of the environmental concerns associated with the digitally mined resource. For example, the gigantic energy requirements in the operation of the network, which totals roughly 127 terawatt-hours a year – more than countries relative to the likes of Norway (Huestis, 2023). At face value, this doesn’t appear sustainable one would say.The only way to know for sure if that’s the case, is if you compared it to the other forms of value exchange the world elects to operate within.Gold has long stood as the absolute pinnacle of safe haven assets. It’s abundant, has a history of value through exchange, and is aesthetically pleasant to the user. Beyond the few electrical applications as a material though, the asset is not inherently valuable. The US Dollar as the current world reserve currency was initially backed by gold reserves, but since the abolishment of the gold standard in the 20th century, the purchasing power of the Dollar has dramatically reduced. This has far greater negative implications towards working class users who save the currency as a means of retirement. Upper class users benefit in the sense of inflated asset values such as property/housing, and other finite assets. Furthermore, and most importantly, both Gold and the US Dollar are not thermodynamically sound mediums of exchange. This has been expressed in the global sense in the third diagram. Gold is extremely inefficient in value exchanging due to the physical properties of the material. First obtaining the mineral is a lengthy energy intensive process with many steps, and when the process is complete,the vast, heavy volumes of Gold must be transported securely to locations around the world to effectively trade. The US Dollar gives one country total control of global economic activity, and the intensive energy requirements of naval supervision and military dominance make it an inefficient monetary network to maintain. The digital nature of bitcoin steps away from the physical limitations of antiquated currencies, and the decentralized aspect of transaction validity can potentially reduce the centralized control of power through traditional financial institutions and governments around the world. The adoption of a new global reserve currency in the form of a digital asset is entirely speculative at this time. With that being said, understanding the potentially positive impact their adoption may occur is not something to ignore or underestimate.The vast network of bitcoin nodes, and the even greater network of interacting users already display the interest on a global level. With enough agreeable interest, will the non-valuable shift to valuable, giving back control of power to the user? Will a new architecture emerge through the digital fabric of the Metaverse? If that’s the case, will the power of a new decentralized means of exchange be met with the same issues as the current centralized method?Can the new money reduce friction in the exchanging of value as digital energy?","heyzeushimseIf"

Brazil has also intensified its regulatory efforts in the cryptocurrency sector, using artificial intelligence and network analysis to track crypto-related activities. Legislation recognizing cryptocurrencies as financial assets has been passed, which will apply taxes to cryptocurrency transactions starting from January 2024. This move is expected to bring more legitimacy to the crypto sector in Brazil and potentially encourage more people to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...

Below is a Tether pro-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> [USDT](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) issued by Tether, a Hong Kong-based company. The token is pegged to the USD by keeping reserves of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills equal to the number of USDT in circulation. Initially named as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain using the Omni platform, it was later renamed USTether and, finally, USDT. In addition to Bitcoin, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **USDT is well established**
> 
> It has built a long history of resilience, reliability and trust because it has been around for a [while](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-23780) (around 8 years in the cryptocurrency market). This had helped to convince clients that the stablecoin is [legitimate](https://www.certik.com/projects/tether?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink).
> 
> As of this year, USDT currently is in the top ten cryptocurrencies by [market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether) with a 24-hour trading volume of around 45 billion dollars and a total number of addresses of up to 4.5 million. In its last known [audit](https://www.fairyproof.com/doc/111.pdf) in 2021 it has been considered to have *""No vulnerabilities with critical, high, medium or low-severity.""*
> 
> **Wide acceptance**
> 
> Tether has multiple gateways for customers (retail, exchanges, and companies) because it is built on several leading [blockchains](https://tether.to/en/supported-protocols), including Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash's Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Polygon, Tezos, Tron, Solana, and Statemine. These transport protocols are made up of open source software that interfaces with blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of Tether tokens.
> 
> Furthermore, it has been available on major exchanges such as Bitfinex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and [more](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether#markets), Offering a plethora of pairs for users to choose from or that of which is available in their region although as of lately some exchanges have been switching to Circle's USDC over growing concerns of legal issues related with Tether.
> 
> **Buffer against volatility**
> 
> One of the primary functions of stablecoins is to act as a [hedge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341245986_Are_stablecoins_truly_diversifiers_hedges_or_safe_havens_against_traditional_cryptocurrencies_as_their_name_suggests) when crypto markets are in a downturn. Because the aforementioned market is extremely volatile, traders and investors want some sort of buffer against this without having to directly trade their crypto for fiat as to also avoid larger fees as well. Supported by its large market capitalization, USDT should be less volatile and thus safer.
> 
> **Announcement of a full audit**
> 
> Tether's CTO Paolo Ardoino recently stated in an [interview](https://www.euromoney.com/article/2a8dpi4tnxahuu98a251c/fintech/cryptocurrencies-tether-is-open-to-providing-more-information) with Euromoney that the company is preparing for a full audit with an accounting firm called MHA Cayman (which also handles Tether's [quarterly assurance opinions/reports](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/1np5dpcwuHrWJ4AgUgI3Vn/e0dac722de3cea07766e05c52773748b/Tether_Assurance_Consolidated_Reserves_Report_2022-03-31__3_.pdf)). According to the CTO in the interview, MHA Cayman is one of the ""*top 12*"" accounting firms, and most top accounting firms deny requests for full audits due to the associated reputational risks. In the future, hopefully, this will provide more security and transparency to its users against the number of allegations and investigations it is currently facing.
> 
> **Despite everything, USDT is still here**
> 
> From the past legal troubles it has faced, the ones it's facing right now, the vast amount of criticisms from different facets off the internet and the several crypto winters it endured. USDT is still alive and kicking. Will it still be the top stablecoin in the next 5 years? Unlikely, but I am for certain it was a major part for the growth and expansion of crypto's fetal years. Moving forward it's up to them, the people behind Tether, if they will finally redeem themselves against all the allegations, criticisms, troubles, and not just do another settlement.

Below is a Tether con-argument written by Blendzi0r.

> *First published on:* [*30.09.2021*](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/hewuzi9/)

> 
> # Intro
> 
> Tether (USDT) is a digital dollar – a stablecoin pegged to US dollar. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency with a value fixed to other assets (usually assets outside of the cryptocurrency space, e.g. fiat currencies, precious metals, etc.). Their main purposes are: 1) help investors escape the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and 2) allow investors to buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges that do not offer fiat deposits. USDT is currently the most popular stablecoin. \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]
> 
> # Cons
> 
> **It’s centralized**
> 
> Tether is centralized. Tether Limited (controlled by the owners of Bitfinex) is responsible for issuing USDT \[1\]. Tether Limited is free to issue and freeze all USDT. When PolyNetwork was famously hacked in August 2021, all of the USDT that hacker stole was frozen and then returned to the victim. There were other such examples in the past (e.g. when KuCoin was hacked in 2020).
> 
> As much as the above examples are positive, nothing stops Tether from being less ethical in the future. Especially taken into consideration their shady history. Not to mention that centralization is against one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies.
> 
> **The company lied on several occasions**
> 
> Tether always claimed that they and Bitfinex are two completely separate entities and denied all the speculations that they are the same. In November 2017, “The Paradise Papers” revealed Bitfinex and Tether are indeed run by the same people. \[4\]
> 
> Until February 2019, Tether claimed to be backed by the US dollar on a one-to-one basis: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.” – read their website. The text was then changed to: “Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves (…) and, from time to time, may include other assets (…).
> 
> However, in April 2019, Tether’s general counsel admitted that the stablecoin can back only around 74% of its supply in circulation \[5\]. It was also reported by the New York Attorney General that at some point in time Tether didn’t even have access to banking services. Therefore, Tether lied about its backing. \[6\]
> 
> Tether promised to share reports from independent auditors on their reserves. They haven’t done so until **forced** by a court order in 2021. And even then they couldn’t stop themselves from misleading the public. In a tweet from Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CTO, he stated that they share the report because “community asked for it."" \[7\]
> 
> **There are some shady people behind it…**
> 
> The most important people at Tether are surrounded by many controversies:
> 
> Jan Ludovicus (or Jean Louis) **van der Velde**, Tether’s CEO, is a ghost. There’s barely any information about him \[4\]. This is rather concerning when you take into consideration he’s a CEO of a multi-billion company.
> 
> **Giancarlo Devasini**, Tether’s CFO, boasts he built companies that generated 100 million euro in revenue but documents show it was almost 10 times less. He was sued by Microsoft for pirating their software and by Toshiba for infringing its DVD-related patents. And these are just a few examples of Devasini’s questionable doings and statements. \[6\]
> 
> **Phil Potter**, CEO of Bitfinex (Bitfinex is the only partner of Tether. And it’s a company that actually controls Tether. So the only partner of Tether is a company that… controls it), was fired from Morgan Stanley in the 90’s after he bragged about his lavish lifestyle in an interview for The New York Times. \[8\]
> 
> Letitia James, the New York attorney-general, called those people “unlicensed and unregulated individuals (…) dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system."" \[6\]
> 
> **…against whom criminal charges might be filed**
> 
> US Justice Department that is investigating Tether and in July 2021 it reported that it is now considering whether it should file criminal charges against Tether executives. The charges might be based on the assumption that Tether lied about its business when it was opening bank accounts all over the world. \[9\]

Below is a Tether pro-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> [USDT](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) issued by Tether, a Hong Kong-based company. The token is pegged to the USD by keeping reserves of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills equal to the number of USDT in circulation. Initially named as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain using the Omni platform, it was later renamed USTether and, finally, USDT. In addition to Bitcoin, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **USDT is well established**
> 
> It has built a long history of resilience, reliability and trust because it has been around for a [while](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-23780) (around 8 years in the cryptocurrency market). This had helped to convince clients that the stablecoin is [legitimate](https://www.certik.com/projects/tether?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink).
> 
> As of this year, USDT currently is in the top ten cryptocurrencies by [market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether) with a 24-hour trading volume of around 45 billion dollars and a total number of addresses of up to 4.5 million. In its last known [audit](https://www.fairyproof.com/doc/111.pdf) in 2021 it has been considered to have *""No vulnerabilities with critical, high, medium or low-severity.""*
> 
> **Wide acceptance**
> 
> Tether has multiple gateways for customers (retail, exchanges, and companies) because it is built on several leading [blockchains](https://tether.to/en/supported-protocols), including Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash's Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Polygon, Tezos, Tron, Solana, and Statemine. These transport protocols are made up of open source software that interfaces with blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of Tether tokens.
> 
> Furthermore, it has been available on major exchanges such as Bitfinex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and [more](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether#markets), Offering a plethora of pairs for users to choose from or that of which is available in their region although as of lately some exchanges have been switching to Circle's USDC over growing concerns of legal issues related with Tether.
> 
> **Buffer against volatility**
> 
> One of the primary functions of stablecoins is to act as a [hedge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341245986_Are_stablecoins_truly_diversifiers_hedges_or_safe_havens_against_traditional_cryptocurrencies_as_their_name_suggests) when crypto markets are in a downturn. Because the aforementioned market is extremely volatile, traders and investors want some sort of buffer against this without having to directly trade their crypto for fiat as to also avoid larger fees as well. Supported by its large market capitalization, USDT should be less volatile and thus safer.
> 
> **Announcement of a full audit**
> 
> Tether's CTO Paolo Ardoino recently stated in an [interview](https://www.euromoney.com/article/2a8dpi4tnxahuu98a251c/fintech/cryptocurrencies-tether-is-open-to-providing-more-information) with Euromoney that the company is preparing for a full audit with an accounting firm called MHA Cayman (which also handles Tether's [quarterly assurance opinions/reports](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/1np5dpcwuHrWJ4AgUgI3Vn/e0dac722de3cea07766e05c52773748b/Tether_Assurance_Consolidated_Reserves_Report_2022-03-31__3_.pdf)). According to the CTO in the interview, MHA Cayman is one of the ""*top 12*"" accounting firms, and most top accounting firms deny requests for full audits due to the associated reputational risks. In the future, hopefully, this will provide more security and transparency to its users against the number of allegations and investigations it is currently facing.
> 
> **Despite everything, USDT is still here**
> 
> From the past legal troubles it has faced, the ones it's facing right now, the vast amount of criticisms from different facets off the internet and the several crypto winters it endured. USDT is still alive and kicking. Will it still be the top stablecoin in the next 5 years? Unlikely, but I am for certain it was a major part for the growth and expansion of crypto's fetal years. Moving forward it's up to them, the people behind Tether, if they will finally redeem themselves against all the allegations, criticisms, troubles, and not just do another settlement.

> # Intro
> 
> Tether (USDT) is a digital dollar – a stablecoin pegged to US dollar. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency with a value fixed to other assets (usually assets outside of the cryptocurrency space, e.g. fiat currencies, precious metals, etc.). Their main purposes are: 1) help investors escape the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and 2) allow investors to buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges that do not offer fiat deposits. USDT is currently the most popular stablecoin. \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]
> 
> # Cons
> 
> **It’s centralized**
> 
> Tether is centralized. Tether Limited (controlled by the owners of Bitfinex) is responsible for issuing USDT \[1\]. Tether Limited is free to issue and freeze all USDT. When PolyNetwork was famously hacked in August 2021, all of the USDT that hacker stole was frozen and then returned to the victim. There were other such examples in the past (e.g. when KuCoin was hacked in 2020).
> 
> As much as the above examples are positive, nothing stops Tether from being less ethical in the future. Especially taken into consideration their shady history. Not to mention that centralization is against one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies.
> 
> **The company lied on several occasions**
> 
> Tether always claimed that they and Bitfinex are two completely separate entities and denied all the speculations that they are the same. In November 2017, “The Paradise Papers” revealed Bitfinex and Tether are indeed run by the same people. \[4\]
> 
> Until February 2019, Tether claimed to be backed by the US dollar on a one-to-one basis: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.” – read their website. The text was then changed to: “Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves (…) and, from time to time, may include other assets (…).

> However, in April 2019, Tether’s general counsel admitted that the stablecoin can back only around 74% of its supply in circulation \[5\]. It was also reported by the New York Attorney General that at some point in time Tether didn’t even have access to banking services. Therefore, Tether lied about its backing. \[6\]
> 
> Tether promised to share reports from independent auditors on their reserves. They haven’t done so until **forced** by a court order in 2021. And even then they couldn’t stop themselves from misleading the public. In a tweet from Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CTO, he stated that they share the report because “community asked for it."" \[7\]

> The most important people at Tether are surrounded by many controversies:
> 
> Jan Ludovicus (or Jean Louis) **van der Velde**, Tether’s CEO, is a ghost. There’s barely any information about him \[4\]. This is rather concerning when you take into consideration he’s a CEO of a multi-billion company.
> 
> **Giancarlo Devasini**, Tether’s CFO, boasts he built companies that generated 100 million euro in revenue but documents show it was almost 10 times less. He was sued by Microsoft for pirating their software and by Toshiba for infringing its DVD-related patents. And these are just a few examples of Devasini’s questionable doings and statements. \[6\]
> 
> **Phil Potter**, CEO of Bitfinex (Bitfinex is the only partner of Tether. And it’s a company that actually controls Tether. So the only partner of Tether is a company that… controls it), was fired from Morgan Stanley in the 90’s after he bragged about his lavish lifestyle in an interview for The New York Times. \[8\]
> 
> Letitia James, the New York attorney-general, called those people “unlicensed and unregulated individuals (…) dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system."" \[6\]
> 
> **…against whom criminal charges might be filed**
> 
> US Justice Department that is investigating Tether and in July 2021 it reported that it is now considering whether it should file criminal charges against Tether executives. The charges might be based on the assumption that Tether lied about its business when it was opening bank accounts all over the world. \[9\]

The approval of bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would provide U.S.-based firms with an opportunity to participate in the crypto market. Market makers play a crucial role in ETFs by creating and redeeming new shares, ensuring the ETF's price aligns with its underlying holdings. The recent court ruling and the SEC's decision not to appeal have increased the likelihood of bitcoin ETFs becoming a reality in the U.S.

"17ku4k7","k79xh91","tldr; The article discusses the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 2. The speculation arises from the SEC's decision not to contest the US Court of Appeals' judgment in favor of Grayscale's bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. A closed-door meeting is scheduled for November 2, where the SEC will discuss the resolution of litigation claims and administrative proceedings. The Bitcoin community is closely watching this scenario, especially after the successful launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The article also mentions the possibility of leaks and the question of whether the SEC will approve only Grayscale or all applicants simultaneously. The SEC has received numerous amendments from other applicants, indicating progress towards approval. However, there are speculations that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler might unexpectedly reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The article concludes by mentioning the current price of Bitcoin.

About 50% of the world’s population lives under authoritarian regimes with unreliable or no banking. If you need to leave and not have all of your wealth confiscated, Bitcoin is one of the best options.

It’s being used as we speak to stabilize power grids(in the real world). If you live in the United States, Texas is an example of this.

I already answered your question and you’re ignoring it. People obviously do use it so what you’re saying is just false. Have a good day.","tbkrida"
"17ktjzf","k7hn9vs","Please understand that gold’s physical use cases only make up less than 10% of its value. I We’re talking about gold and Bitcoin as money. Bitcoin is the superior form of money. 

Gold is scarce, but it’s considerably less scarce than Bitcoin. Gold is not easily transferable. Imagine trying to transfer $1 billion in gold. Try transferring a bunch of gold across borders in normal times or in an emergency. Gold is also less secure than Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is has absolute scarcity. It is very easily transferrable. You can transfer over $1 billion worth of value in one transaction for a small fee almost instantaneously from anywhere as long as you remember a 12 word password. Bitcoin is more secure. Gold is able to be counterfeited. People cover Tungsten in gold plate to try to pass it as gold. You can’t fake Bitcoin. 

I remember being where you are in your journey. If you’re saying that Bitcoin is the most useless variation of cryptocurrency, then you have a long way to go. The facts and the world are telling us all the opposite.

I suggest you read and understand this…

As for the point about my alleged insecurities? You’re the one who replied, and I quote “As I expected, an answer with no substance…” I’m failing to see how me responding to this is an indicator of me being insecure? Please, explain it to me like I’m five.","UniqueID89"
"17ktjzf","k7i41li","Yeah but when you look at the fundamentals of BTC it's all based around hype and its OG status, never upgrading it to anything better, even though Satoshi left options open for it to be soft/hard forked/modified. The current status is to intentionally artificially drive up the price through increased complexity and forcing higher fees after each halving.

BTC is the primary ticker for the market, but just because it is the primary market driver doesn't mean that it's this extraordinary network. The P2P function is basically dead, and it's primarily owned and traded on centralized exchanges.

It wasn't until Ordinals came out, that I became very suspect of the future of BTC, where empty transactions loaded to the nines with data could bottleneck the network that easily, and with Bitcoin Core being so adamant about never modifying block sizes, it's not really a good thing.

Your answer of “Yes, we all know it does anything and everything the community wants it to” is also making the assumption that I believe that.

It’s being used as we speak to stabilize power grids(in the real world). If you live in the United States, Texas is an example of this. 

It’s the most secure Network on the planet. I still can’t understand how people don’t see value in that. Try to steal off of the blockchain without a HODLer’s user error! Lol

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain.

> **Early Buyers have the Higher Ground.**
> 
> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**
> 
> * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.

You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

You had to use various dodgey websites and basically trust they were going to send it to your dodgey wallet because there was nobody to ask about it. So I gave up. Then I came back to it shortly after and the price was shooting up so I went to the trouble of actually buying it, which wasn't easy at all and took a few days to complete.

When I first looked I was an apprentice so I didn't have much money. I think I was going to spend either £250 or £400. Either way, I'd have paid off my house by now because it peaked right around the time I was buying my house so id have sold it and bought my house cash.

Either your math is out or your time is out.  Bitcoin didn't reach a price of 2500 per coin until 2017, six years ago.

> hence 40x would be £100,000 per coin and I'm out

That's 2017 (6 years ago), not 2014 (9 years ago).  If you had bought bitcoin in 2014, when the price dropped from about $1000 to $200 or so, but spent most of the time hovering around $350, you would already be at 100x.","Frogolocalypse"

Bitcoin has since become increasingly adopted globally, with El Salvador making it legal tender and plans for a Bitcoin City. Financial institutions are also applying to offer Bitcoin ETFs.

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.

> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  
> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...

"17kj0jz","k79f65g","Nobody ever said anything about 500MB blocks, or Bitcoin competing with Visa out of the gate..

Satoshi's instructions to Gavin Anderson were to scale the chain by 30% each 2 years, which fits well under Moore's law. After 15 years (today) the blocksize would be 6.27MB, and in 15 more it would be 51.18MB with 365 TPS (nearly 1000TPS with Segwit) throughput. PayPal's TPS is 193 while Visa's is 1700, in the US today.

6.27MB blocks would equal 900MB of growth per day, almost 330GB per year. Which is worth about $3-4 in disk space, down from over $30 in 2009.

Bitcoin, following Satoshi's advice, wouldn't achieve 500MB blocks until the year 2057. Following Moore's law, and historical cost data for disk storage, would cost $0.0001544 in storage per block, about $0.022 per day or $8 per year to maintain. Bitcoin by then would achieve 3500 TPS without Segwit, with absolutely astonishing intrinsic value that we would all speculate on increasing more with time.

These institutional miners that make up the majority, with facilities that take minutes to drive by, can't afford >$10 a year in upkeep without the whole thing becoming more centralized? I mean, just think a second about why you can't mine at-profit now.

Bitcoin *by design* is reliant on increasing fee revenues, thanks to an exponentially halving distribution/subsidy. Read: incentives, in the whitepaper. Without fee revenue Bitcoin will surely become insecure and die. No, I don't think 2-4MB is enough because right now miners are getting paid 99% through temporary subsidies and 1% from selling blockspace. That isn't sustainable without keeping that temporary subsidy in place indefinitely ie forking to remove the 21M coin limit, which by then Bitcoin will be something *entirely* different than what Satoshi baked up.

No fee revenue will become a problem a few halvings from now, as the subsidy falls from 900BTC per day to 14BTC per day then as quickly to below 1BTC. BTC can't 2x each 4 years to offset halvings forever without all the money in the world and then some, and there's no reason to expect it too either when over 95% of BTC are in circulation already (so, diminishing miner supply shocks). 

Compare whatever could've been, with having 7 TPS in the year 2057 like pet rock maxis wanted. Bitcoin's immaculate start has gone to waste, unfortunately.","Giga79"

Visa has more than 24,000 transactions per second.

You'll need bigger blocks than 6mb. Segwit brings up to 4mb already.

How would Bitcoin compete with an already satisfactory payment method regardless of the blocksize?

It's not what Bitcoin was made for I don't care what the tagline in white paper is or how many times cash is mentioned.

Bitcoin brings us something we didn't have before. A currency with no central institution to inflate or to censor txs.

>These institutional miners that make up the majority, with facilities that take minutes to drive by, can't afford >$10 a year in upkeep without the whole thing becoming more centralized? I mean, just think a second about why you can't mine at-profit now.

You're forgetting about the nodes. No one is downloading giant blockchains.

It won't be used for groceries at that stage. L2 or L3 will handle that. Everyone else will be happy to pay big fees for settlements. Still far cheaper and quicker than gold.

"17kj0jz","k7d34qe","Well, what's the cost factor limit per Gb?

20 years ago 100 TB cost $400K. Today it costs about $1000. A cost reduction of 400 in 20 years. If that happens even once more in the future, on any timescale, 100 TB will cost $2.50. Is this +100% already past physical limits do you think?

40 years from now, at 500MB blocksize, that's a whopping 26TB of state growth per year. Using my pesemmistic Moore's *halflaw* instead now, that would cost $65 in disk space per year. If 500MB blocks persisted for 20 years and disk storage didn't get any cheaper, to run a full node would require $1000 in storage space, which isn't small but not absurd considering.

I think betting the security budget on *nothing* instead is a far larger gamble, than betting on Moore's law persisting indefinitely. Ie halvings. Miners are doing POW for 900 BTC per day today, and in 40 years they'll be doing POW for 0.43 BTC per day. Today they'll spend up to 900 BTC to mine 900 BTC which equals about $30M. To maintain the same $30M of POW input into the future requires the price of BTC to 2x each halving, in 40 years that's 2050x in price to $62M per coin with a $1.3 quadrillion market cap, which by then $30M imo absolutely won't be enough. Next halving after the price still must double to $2.6 quadrillion, then $5.2 quadrillion, so on, but even though it must, why would it? Obviously at some point BTC *can't* 2x and POW input will decrease, miners won't work at a loss. The chain will become insecure as a result, without some viable fee revenue stream to replace the temporary block subsidy - as per the whitepaper.

Either way it's a massive gamble. Either central banks hyperinflate in tandum and put all that money into BTC to maintain a meager hashprice, otherwise Moore's Law persists 1/4 to 1/2 speed for the next 40 years instead. Hard to say which is more likely at such great timescales, but, the former isn't what I'm betting on personally. I'd like to see some middle ground met so in either case Bitcoin doesn't become insecure or useless.","Giga79"
"17kj0jz","k7c98mr","Well i mean, it does work, but it’s a bit messy to operate a node if i’m honest. I’ve been running one for bit over 2 years but it’s easier to just use something like Phoenix instead.

"17kj0jz","k7fgrqb",">If that happens even once more in the future, on any timescale, 100 TB will cost $2.50. Is this +100% already past physical limits do you think?

Very likely. Then again, maybe someone will come up with a genius solution, but, most of the improvements in price currently are from making manufacturing less expensive.

>Using my pesemmistic Moore's halflaw instead now

The issue is that at some point there will no longer be this linear improvement because physical limitations will cap out improvements, which, you could argue is already occurring if you look at the price per gb over time. We're already hitting this limit with processing power, though there is still some more performance to be squeezed out yet.

>I think betting the security budget on nothing instead is a far larger gamble, than betting on Moore's law persisting indefinitely. Ie halvings.

The chain will become insecure as a result, without some viable fee revenue stream to replace the temporary block subsidy - as per the whitepaper.

Right, which is why the blocksize for bitcoin must increase at some point. Will that happen? Unlikely, bitcoiners are obsessed with this idea of ""digital gold"" and will almost certainly not accept a fork increasing the blocksize out of fear of change or whatever it is that keeps them stuck in 2010.

There's also the problem that there might not ever be enough demand to fill blocks. I know people are obsessed with this idea that cryptocurrencies are going to completely replace fiat, but this is unlikely. Again, wont be addressed in bitcoin for the aforementioned reason.

Anyways I don't disagree that bitcoin needs a larger blocksize, but I don't think using Moore's law is a good argument as we are already seeing that the rate of progress, especially in data storage, is slowing.","Inaeipathy"

You can either sell your round number and non-round number together (and pay fees and spread on the total), and then buy back your round number (and pay fees and spread on the round number)... or you can just sell the non-round number and pay fees and spread on that.

In the former, you obviously pay more to end up with the same result.   Clearly, the latter option is superior.","jps_"

When you say cash out do you mean trade your crypto for a stable coin? Or do you mean taking the stable coin / fiat off the exchange? Either way you need to check the trading fees and withdrawal fees for your exchanges. Trading fees are sometimes 0 depending on the exchange, in which case you can trade around your crypto however you like to get the numbers you're after. Withdrawals usually have fees, so withdrawing fewer times will cost you less in fees (and whatever it costs you to send the fees back into the exchange).","Tanikushokutomu"

Anyways, the answer your question. I would recommend you to look up DCA. But to answer your question about fees. It's a %. Like there is a buys/sells within given levels decrease in how much fees are the more you trade. But for the amount you are talking about, you likely won't be hitting it.

The fee won't be 10% but to keep math easy lets say it was. If you were to cash out $100 then the fee is $10 for $1k then it's $100. So yes but the % is the same.  


The thing you need to watch out for is transfer fees. That highly depends on the amount you are moving. But I have my doubts you are moving enough to matter in that anyways.","crua9"

"17ju4wt","k739bn7","tldr; Bitcoin has doubled in value this year, reaching over $34,000, but there are no signs of overheating in the market, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. The firm's analysis of the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio suggests that bitcoin is not as overheated as it has been in previous bull markets. The MVRV ratio currently stands at 170%, significantly lower than the 300% threshold that has historically marked major market tops. This indicates that the current bull market may have further room to run. Additionally, the low investor interest in trading meme cryptocurrencies like SHIB suggests that bitcoin's peak may be higher than the recent high of $35,000. However, investors should remain cautious of potential geopolitical tensions and an oil rally, as these factors could lead to a correction in the market.

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.
> 
> The resilience of Bitcoin is largely due to the fact that the hashrate symbolizes competition=> If the hashrate falls, then it is more profitable for other miners to keep mining or for new miners to start mining. This balance is what makes Bitcoin very resilient.

> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  
> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.

It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...

The number of transactions involving at least $100,000 worth of BTC reached a year-to-date high of 23,400. This surge in activity is attributed to increased appetite from whales and institutions due to the anticipation of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Retail investors have also become more active, indicating growing interest in the market. The SEC is expected to approve spot-based ETFs early next year, which could further boost Bitcoin's market value.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

> # Bitcoin, could it be wrong. ""Are we the bad guys ?"" 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> In this small write up, I am going to delve into con-arguments against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the flagship of cryptocurrencies but there are a lot of criticism that could be leveraged against Bitcoin. First of all, let's delve into a small presentation of Bitcoin. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: An introduction. 
> 
> Bitcoin is the biggst cryptocurrency. It was created by a mysterious figure. The creation of Bitcoin is a strange and mysterious  mystery. No one knows who created Bitcoin.  
>   
> Bitcoin was started as a way to circumvent traditional banking. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology. Blockchain can be seen as an open book allowing anyone to know where is each fraction of Bitcoin ever.  
>   
> This blockchain is maintained through computer power. In a vulgar way: Bitcoin is mined by solving math problems. The maths problem becomes harder when more people are mining so that mining takes a fixed amount of time according to a timeline known to everyone. In order to respect this timeline, mining rewards are halved every few years.  
>   
> Since anyone who wants to validate transactions is forced to complete a very hard math problem (which becomes harder the more people are mining), no one can cheat in new transactions. Also, every other miner has a copy of the blockchain. Through making sure that no entity has 50% of the mining, you can stop nefarious actors from changing the blockchain.  
>   
> This is using cryptographic technology that I don't yet understand but you can read more about it here:  
>   
> Bitcoin Wikipedia  
>   
> Without delving more into the tech side of bitcoin. Which can also be explained through youtube videos here: Bitcoin explained  
>   
> The Metrics of Bitcoin are currently: 22400$ Per coin for a Market cap of 430 Bilions and a daily volume of 19 Billions. Bitcoin was shortly valued at 69000 usd during the ATH.  
>   
> Now let's dive into what is making Bitcoin so bad.
> 
> # Permissionless: A senseless destruction of world order. 
> 
> Bitcoin is a project existing in a very delicate world balanced by power structure. While we can be happy that the current top dog is the US (yes they are not perfect BUT they could be worse) we know that someone else could be on top. Despite that, we should strive to use the current US dominance to curb rogue states into the world order. 
> 
> The current war in Ukraine is a demonstration of the world order crumbling to maintain itself. I'd argue, the rise of cryptocurrencies may be a part of this crumbling. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that, Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar would usher a chaotic age of international relation. 
> 
> The world has shrank a lot since the rise of internet. The fact is that the stability of the world is much more precious than ever. Everyone can see what happens in any other country and how the supply chains which guarantee our comfort are of the utmost importance. YET, we are pushing forward a great disrupter of balance. 
> 
> Permissionless can help terrorists, permissionless can help crime. YES traditionnal banking is doing it already BUT I'd argue that the absence of regulator and watchdog to make the current system comply is not an argument in favor of a tech which will make regulation and surveillance harder. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: This MONEY Doesn't Work, This Money Doesn't WORK. 
> 
> Bitcoin is claiming to be a currency. A viable alternative to fiat money. But anyone with a neuron or two could realize that the fluctuation in the value of Bitcoin is crazy. Some pedentic nerd and bitcoin maximalist could argue that 1 BTC = 1 BTC BUT if you don't know how much you'll need to put food on the table then BTC is not working as a currency. Yes inflation is lowering the value of Fiat BUT fiat doesn't see wild swings of + or -  30 % in most economies. 
> 
> While not being really MONEY I'd argue that Bitcoin doesn't WORK. To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account. This movement has created economic vitality. Bitcoin, most of the time, is seen as an investment vehicle such as gold. I'd argue that these vehicle are not valuable for society since the freeze money in place. 
> 
> In a bank, your money is working. Instead of Bitcoin, people should be paid more by banks to put their money in investment portfolios since these provide the liquidity necessary to make the economy work. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Bitcoin: A very big spending of energy. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Bitcoin is a project which is wasting a lot of ressource for something which is not making a lot of sense. While Bitcoin is using more and more green energy, I'd argue that it is still a big waste. Subsidies could prop up the green sector far better than the mining farms that go with windfarms. 
> 
> Seeing Bitcoin as one of the biggest leverage of the green sector is a non-sense. Optimization of the energy sector means that the variable production should allow to reduce the use of fossil energy. Not allow to waste energy in a senseless project. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: The harsh truth is, we may be the bad guys. 
> 
> Partaking in an economic sector which allows for a disruption of world order, which doesn't help the economy and which is wasting energy may not be beneficial. This is why Bitcoin should not be seen as a messiah of economic proportion but as something which should raise criticism and should be heavily regulated. 
> 
> Good luck in your investments.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...

> Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized.

Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.

What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.

To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account.

"17jlxm1","k71xs4e","#Cosmos Pro-Arguments
Below is a Cosmos pro-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent blockchains that have the capability of scaling and operating with each other. The main goal of Cosmos is the creation of the ""Internet of Blockchains"" by which blockchains can communicate with each other in a decentralized manner. It's first blockchain, Cosmos Hub, has it's native token called ATOM which as a spam-prevention mechanism, as a staking token, and as a voting mechanism in governance. ([1](https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **Application Interoperability**
> 
> * One of the issues in blockchain today is interoperable networks. Average users will always have trouble transferring assets from one network to another, often times it's so complex that they get the order wrong and won't get the assets back. Cosmos' Internet of Blockchains (IBC) provides the means of interoperability by creating ""zones"" and ""hubs"". Zones are considered regular various blockchains while Hubs are the blockchains that connect the zones. With this idea in hand you can think of a hub as a router while the IBC protocol is the standard of communication. ([2](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro#connecting-blockchains-together-ibc))
> 
> **Scalability**
> 
> * Another common issue among blockchains is the ability to scale as usage, traffic, and users increases. Cosmos tackles scalability with two methods:
> 
> 1. Vertical Scalability - Scaling of the blockchain itself with the help of COSMOS SDK   
> (*The Cosmos SDK is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as application-specific blockchains.* [*Source*](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/intro/overview)*)*
> 2. Horizontal Scalability - When a vertically-scaled blockchain reaches it's limit, multiple parallel chains will be running the same application and will be operated by a common validator set, making blockchains theoretically indefinitely scalable. Note that this is not a finished function yet and the result are still pending.
> 
> * It is true that the issue with scalability is one of major ones if not the biggest to be faced  in todays generation of blockchains, what COSMOS is offering in it's approach to the issue seems to be unique and effective in that it relies on technology behind the COSMOS SDK application. ([3](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro#Solving%20Scalability))
> 
> **Ease for Developers**
> 
> * Developers are the one's mostly responsible for the birth of a blockchain and without their expertise none of this would even come to fruition. With Cosmos' Tendermint, developers will have more time to focus solely on the application-layer of the blockchain rather than the underlying protocols within a certain blockchain and thus saving them precious time. Tendermint enables developers to use it as a very flexible tool that is both secure and high performing without having to build a blockchain from scratch.

"17jlxm1","k71xshe","#Cosmos Con-Arguments
Below is a Cosmos con-argument written by Shippior.

> \[Cosmos\](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos-hub) (ATOM) is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. It is the center of the Cosmos networks, including Osmosis, Juno, Secret, Evmos and 50+ other independent L1 chains which are all connected, called Gaia. Something that is not known to many people is that the Binance Chain actually uses the same software as Cosmos and is thus in theory compatible with Gaia. However so far Binance has made the design choice not to enable it as to keep their authority over their BNB chain  ATOM uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerance as main consensus in it's \[Tendermint consensus\](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html).   
>   
> The main strongsuit of Cosmos is the use of \[IBC\](https://ibcprotocol.org/) (Inter-Blockchain Communication). It is a protocol that is integrated in the Tendermint Cosmos SDK that is used to trustlessly communicate between chains. This allows new chains using this SDK to quickly integrate into the entire network and make use of all the capabilities of the other chains. Bridges between different networks have shown to be a weak point in architecture with the \[Nomad hack\](https://halborn.com/the-nomad-bridge-hack-a-deeper-dive/) and the \[Wormhole bridge hack\](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/wormhole-hack-february-2022/) as recent examples. Therefore relying on IBC, which essentially are many bridges is a risk. So far it has been closely monitored. Many IBC connections to LUNC where disabled quickly after the crash to limit the number of funds siphoned from the other networks but serious TVL has been lost through the LUNC crash, NOMAD bridge exploit and Crypto.com crash from the Cosmos networks. The network effect does not only share the good things but unfortunately also the bad events. In October it was even reported that a critical issue in the IBC was found after a \[security audit\](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cosmos-co-founder-says-a-major-security-vulnerability-has-been-uncovered-on-ibc). It was quickly patched but one remains to wonder what happens is a critical exploit in IBC is not caught on time.  
>   
> Currently Cosmos has no native stablecoins in the network after the Luna crash took UST with it. The main dominance of stablecoins is from USDC through the Axelar bridge. Therefore the dependence on this Axelar bridge is very large. This has led to the call to have a native stablecoin in the Cosmos network. USDC is said to bring a native USDC version to Cosmos in the beginning of 2023. In the man time there have been popping up stablecoins left and right, most of them algorithmic backed. Examples are \[IST\](https://01node.com/ist-the-new-cosmos-stablecoin-built-on-agoric/), \[CMST\](https://blog.comdex.one/introducing-composite-a-collateralized-stablecoin-for-ibc-bc76e15fa2ec) and \[SILK\](https://scrt.network/blog/shade-protocol-silk-privacy-preserving-stablecoin). However the introduction of this many stablecoins have led to fighting over which one is best and has spread the liquidity of these stablecoins thin which make them vulnerable for depegging.  
>   
> Governance is an important part of Cosmos, it tries to enable self-governance and sovereignty. Though with the full Governance abilities that Cosmos brings it also brings a lot of infighting. In the Stargate Upgrade the Gravity Dex was envisioned. This was supposed to be the DEX for ATOM. However it was seen by the community as a sponsored DEX from the community pool that was to compete with the already existing DEXs in the Cosmos Hub like Osmosis and Sifchain. This led to the failure of Gravity Dex, which subsequently rebranded as \[Crescent Network\](https://app.crescent.network/). It currently sits at about $7mill Total volume locked (TVL) compared to $150mill  TVL on \[Osmosis\](https://info.osmosis.zone/), the most popular DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem.  
>   
> Later on there was a lot of discussion around \[proposal #82\](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/82). As the previous roadmap had ended it was time to come to a new roadmap. ATOM 2.0 was the proposal that was pitched during  the \[Cosmoverse\](https://cosmoverse.org/), the annual Cosmos conferential. The proposal included new tokenomics for ATOM that would increase the inflation on the short term to decrease it further more in the long term. Jae Kwon, one of the founders of Cosmos, called the proposal \[outright theft\](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/11/cosmos-founder-jae-kwon-says-he-is-against-proposed-changes-to-atom-token/) from the community.   
>   
> However this leaves ATOM still without much value. Currently the main value ATOM provides is a store of value and it is often used as a criteria for receiving airdrops from newly launched chains but it has been passed left and right by chains that offer more utility than ATOM has. As long as there is no consensus about the new roadmap it is going to be difficult to add value to holding ATOM. Looking at it closely shows that it has little to offer that competitors like Ethereum, Polkadot and Avalanche do not also offer.

"17jdp2q","k70etye","I understand your skepticism about mentioning ICP alongside established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a new project, ICP has a long way to go before reaching their level of adoption and proven staying power. However, I believe it's worth keeping an open mind about ICP's potential based on the novelty of its technology vision and engineering talent behind it. 

While Bitcoin was revolutionary in decentralizing currency and Ethereum took decentralization further with smart contracts, ICP is pioneering an entirely new blockchain-based approach to internet services. Building dApps and systems natively on its protocol is an ambitious undertaking. If successful, it could represent a major evolution in leveraging blockchain for practical use cases.

Of course, potential and vision alone don't guarantee success. ICP is still highly experimental and has many challenges to overcome in delivering on its promises. But so too did Bitcoin and Ethereum in their early days. Radical new ideas require an initial leap of faith before proving themselves over time. 

My goal is not to prematurely place ICP on equal footing with Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have undoubtedly stood the test of time. I simply aim to recognize ICP's conceptual innovation and acknowledge the possibility that it could ultimately join their ranks if it continues to execute well. While skepticism is warranted, I believe keeping an open mind allows us to see the blockchain landscape with greater clarity.","therealestx"

Host full web services and dapps natively on-chain rather than just smart contracts

Enable ""gasless"" transactions where users don't need crypto to pay fees

Achieve high transaction speeds without needing off-chain Layer 2 scaling solutions

Use novel cryptography like Chain Key Technology and Threshold Relay for security and consensus

Provide instantiated compute capacity via node machines to run dapps

Support backend database functionality on-chain

Develop using conventional programming languages rather than needing to learn Solidity ( Python, typescript and so on)

Allow cross-chain interoperability between blockchains on the protocol level ie Bitcoin and Ethereum integration, soon every blockchain. 

Facilitate internet service integration without centralized servers

DAO controlled and governed dApps ( both backends and frontends on-chain.

In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production.

> Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

> Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.
> 
> The resilience of Bitcoin is largely due to the fact that the hashrate symbolizes competition=> If the hashrate falls, then it is more profitable for other miners to keep mining or for new miners to start mining. This balance is what makes Bitcoin very resilient.

> ​  
> The Energy Fud Was Killed  
> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  
> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.  
> There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.

> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.

This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.

The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

> 
> * **Reliability**
> 
> Launched in 2016, Ethereum has been very reliable. Some networks (e.g. Solana) had more issues in single week than Ethereum in all its history. The only issues I can remember is of course the [famous hack](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/17/the-55m-hack-that-almost-brought-ethereum-down/) (it was in the beginning of ETH) that led to the creation of ETH Classic and the network congestion in 2017 caused by… [internet cats](https://consensys.net/blog/news/the-inside-story-of-the-cryptokitties-congestion-crisis/). What else could it be, right?

> 
> * **Adoption**
> 
> One of the biggest advantages of Ethereum is its widespread adoption. It had the first mover advantage and it used it pretty well. Today the [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/) includes dozens of members, among them such big names as JP Morgan, Ernst & Young or Microsoft
> 
> Every regular visitor to r/cryptocurrency is also probably aware that Reddit chose Ethereum for their community points program. Currently Moons run on one of Ethereum layer 2 protocols called Arbitrum Nova
>

> * **Advantages of PoW -> PoS transition**
> 
> Transition from PoW to PoS of course has some disadvantages (the rich get richer) but it’s hard to deny that there are also some advantages. And probably the biggest one is the energy usage decrease. The [energy used by Ethereum is now almost 100% lower](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more) than when it was a PoW coin
> 
> The other advantage of recent updates is the fact that ETH is now deflationary. After the implementation of EIP-1559 ETH now burns a fraction of the gas fees per transaction (so there are some positive sides to high fees too – more ETH is burned :P). [This year, in less than 3 months, more than 66,000 ETH was burned](https://finbold.com/ethereum-supply-drops-by-66000-eth-in-2023-making-it-deflationary/)
> 
> And it’s not the end. Soon, on 12 April 2023, ETH will have another upgrade called Shanghai-Capella (Shapella). One of its improvements is [EVM Object Format](https://sensoriumxr.com/articles/375). It will separate code from data. It should make the network easier to use and it will reduce gas fees
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * **Layer 2 solutions**
> 
> One of the biggest problems of Ethereum are high gas fees. But thanks to a very active community and smart develoeprs this problem is circumvented. Layer 2 protocols have very low fees while utilizing the benefits of Ethereum blockchain. They decrease data traffic by redirecting it offchain

There is nothing strange about that but since ETH puts a lot of focus on security, it means that storage and processing power costs more. And the more popular ETH becomes, the higher the cost of storage and processing power becomes = the gas fees are more expensive. It is not easy to solve this problem. Just look at Solana – it has very small fees but its security has more holes than a Swiss cheese. This is why there are second layer (L2) solution

For the network, the node operators aren’t incentivized to be good actors or to do a good job because the rewards they receive won’t be effected if their actions cause the price to go down.


For the tokenomics, as the price of ICP goes down, the amount of ICP tokens required to pay the node operators goes up. So, ICP becomes more inflationary as the price decreases which causes a snowball effect  on the valuation of the token.

"17jdp2q","k73usrl","No they wouldn't be fine. Basically almost everybody that interacts with crypto would not know where to go to interact with the blockchain if the 3 major cloud providers flip the switch as the applications themselves are built on those platforms ( see what happens to Parler). If all corporate cloud providers were to shut down, people on ICP would not notice it because the physical infrastructure is owned by independent parties that runs in parallel to the cloud. 

Devx is getting better as teams build platforms as-a -service that abstract away the blockchain aspects of the Internet Computer, while still retaining the properties of blockchains. [Juno](https://juno.build/) is one of those platforms that makes it easier to forget the blockchain aspect of ICP and build you would in Web 2. A Wix like platform is being built right now to make it even easier for people who can't to easily build websites. 

NNS isn't perfect but is an improvement over off chain governance where a few powerful people make the important decisions in a backroom. At least there is mechanism in place to ensure people are heard based on skins in the game. 


A single security issue in any single data center would not inherently compromise the entire Internet Computer network. Here's why:

The network utilizes a consensus protocol that requires participation from multiple independent node operators. A problem in one data center would not compromise others.

Smart contracts and data are distributed across the network. There is no central point where all data is stored that could be breached.

The network can sustain a threshold of node failures or compromises and still function securely due to algorithmic fault tolerance.

I have heard your arguments before and they don't stand to simple research and reasoning.


So what this space is about is building crypto on corporate cloud? I would say that this is very anti-crypto. In fact, ICP is very much like Bitcoin in terms of networks, sovereignty.

There is nothing highly scalable about blockchain technology, literally everyone knows this. You are not going to put the information from giant datacenters into a blockchain where everyone downloads this information. Yes, serving web contents via smart contracts is a gimmick because it serves no purpose other than to invent a need for a token that was presold at an absurd price defrauding people who ""invested"" in it.

The IC isn't simply a blockchain. The architecture allows it to do things that traditional blockchains cannot do. [How ICP works ](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works)

1. There are things you can do with bitcoin besides payment. For example. You can use it for collateral to borrow against stable against it. The internet computer is integrated with bitcoin on a protocol level, which means whatever you can do with ICP you can do it with a wrapped version on the internet computer. The IC smart contracts can sign Bitcoin directly.

Smart contracts being able to do HTTP outcalls is a huge freaking deal. You can securely bring data on chain without using an intermediary as all calls go through consensus [IC HTTP outcalls ](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls)

2. Not all gaming required high speed. There are some games that make sense to build on chains and others not so much. It's up to developers to decide how they want to build their games. ICP simply extends their options. 

3. Internet ID. Let me help you here ( [internet identity](https://identitydeck.internetcomputer.org/)

4. Canisters are mutable by default, although you can make them immutable as needed, meaning data on the internet computer works very much like conventional database. Stored data don't have to stay on chain forever. 

5. State bloat isn't possible on the internet computer. Nothing is stored forever if it isn't paid for. It's not ""paid once, store forever"" platform. Developers have to continue charging their applications. Otherwise the protocol will automatically delete the data.

0% of Ethereum applications live on or settle on anything but Ethereum. It is completely irrelevant that some of the ecosystem nodes can be turned off by a cloud provider.

 Ethereum is a traditional distributed ledger that runs token transactions.It makes sense for it to run on consumer hardware. ICP is not trying to be ethereum or any crypto. It's much more than that.The goal of the Internet Computer is to create a decentralized internet where software can be built and run with the same capabilities as traditional web services, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. The difference between the IC and other Blockchains is the infrastructure is run by independent parties throughout the world. Again, ICP's deterministic decentralization integrates node hardware from diverse owners, data centers, geographies, and jurisdictions, which by definition is anything but web2. It's very resistant to regulatory capture since nodes that make the various subnets are run from different countries and jurisdictions but this is not the main point of the platform. It seeeks to provide an alternative to centralized corporate cloud which makes up the bulk of the internet infrastructure today.  Platform risk is a bigger concern as far as ICP is concerned as proven by Heztner actions against Solana last year. They banned Crypto entirely from their from cloud services.

> 
> # Ethereum: Use-case driving value
> 
> Ethereum is a very valuable Blockchain. This blockchain is driven by innovation and utility. To understand what makes Ethereum such a valuable eco-system we need to discuss the inner-working of Ethereum.
> 
> # Introduction: Ethereum explained
> 
> According to [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) :
> 
> >What is Ethereum?
> 
> Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet.
> 
> So the topic driving this discussion is badly worded. If we are discussing top coins then we should discuss Ether and not Ethereum. Since Ethereum is such an interesting ecosystem I will treat this argument as a pro Ethereum post. I'd love to see the discussion focused on Ether next time.
> 
> Ethereum is not managed by a single entity nor managed by the Ethereum Foundation but is managed through a decentralized process explained [In their governance page](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/).
> 
> Time for some metrics: Ethereum is currently trading north of 1750 $ and has a circulating supply of 122 millions ETH for a Market cap at around 218 billions
> 
> Let's go back to the quote: ""Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money"". This point is important. Ether is not the only coin which is using the Ethereum blockchain. A lot of value on the Ethereum Blockchain is not in Ether coins. This will be discussed further down. Ethereum is also home to global payment, so Ether and other cryptocurrencies can be used to settle transactions between P2P in a permissionless way.
> 
> Applications called Dapps exist on the blockchain. We are going to discuss all of these aspects. We are also going to tackle NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain.
> 
> Ethereum is also completed by L2s. These are going to be mentioned.
> 
> Ethereum has been switched from POW to Asic resistant POW to POS. These are going to be discussed.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to digital money.
> 
> Ethereum strength is that the blockchain is home to many cryptocurrencies. If gas fees are paid in Ether, many tokens have billions circulating in the Ethereum ecosystem. A quick look at Etherscans reveal how strong the ethereum ecosystem is.
> 
> According to [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/tokens) the blockchain has 40 Billions $ in USDT, 46 Billions in USDC and 7 Billions $ in Wrapped BTC. The market cap of Ether may be around 200 billions but the on chain value of assets in the Ethereum Blockchain is far higher.
> 
> All of these USDT and USDC are stablecoins which can be used for transactions. In fact, it can be used for P2P transaction in a permissionless way but also to buy stuff from businesses. [Here is a list of business accepting USDT (which exists in the Ethereum blockchain)](https://nowpayments.io/blog/businesses-accepting-tether) and [Here is a list of business accepting directly Ethereum](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-companies-accepting-ethereum-as-a-payment-method-in-2022/)
> 
> These classical transactions are not the only use of the Ethereum Blockchain: Dapps and NFT are also thriving !
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to dapps and NFTs
> 
> Ethereum is home to a lot of different applications: Marketplaces, exchanges, defi, wallets, games...
> 
> These application are different because they are called dapps:
> 
> >A decentralised application (DApp,\[1\] dApp,\[2\] Dapp, or dapp) is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that run on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system.\[3\]
> 
> [Wikipedia Dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application)
> 
> To give a glance to these dapps you can head to this website tho be wary of the first dapp listed being an advertisement for shady businesses (I haven't found a better website to source dapps) [Here you go](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum/1)
> 
> While I don't believe in the current state of NFT technology being viable (See my write up in favor of NFT speaking about the future of this technology), we have to take into account that even after losing 60% of their value there is still 3 Billions USD in NFTs in the Ethereum Blockchain [Source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-nft-collections-lost-nearly-60-of-their-market-cap-in-2022-report)
> 
> # Ethereum: Layers of goodness.
> 
> Ethereum can be a bit expensive for people, this is why it was layered. There are side chains existing just to be cheaper than Ethereum while offering bridges to and from Ethereum. For example Polygon.
> 
> >Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution created to help bring mass adoption to the Ethereum platform. It caters to the diverse needs of developers by providing tools to create scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that prioritize performance, user experience (UX), and security.
> 
> So if you want to be able to evaluate Ethereum you need to go and read about the biggest layer 2 pro and cons.
> 
> [A small list of Ethereum layer 2 given by Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)
> 
> # Ethereum: Evolve to thrive
> 
> Ethereum has been a rapidly evolving ecosystem. It has seen the evolution of mining from GPU to Asic. In order to not become reliant on Asic mining, Ethereum was made Asic resistant. This created other problems: A pressure on the GPU market but also a concern for energy efficiency. In order to improve the footprint but also reduce the fees, Ethereum was made to transistion from POW to POS. Proof of stake is a protocol in which you need to stake coins to run a node in the network.
> 
> This shows an ability to look ahead and to tackle challenges.
> 
> # Conclusion: Ethereum is a rapidly evolving ecosystem which has a lot of value in it. Since Ether is their native coin, all of this impacts Ether's value.
> 
> This is where we go back to the TOP COIN aspect of this write up. Everything I have said has an impact on the value and use of Ether. If you believe in the future of the Ethereum Blockchain, you can go ahead and look a bit more into Ether. If you don't believe in the Ethereum Blockchain then you should try to find a competitor.

> Ethereum is being shown favoritism and privilege by US regulators. This is the biggest con for Ethereum. Early promoters of Ethereum approached and worked closely with the SEC to shield it from any securities laws. The arguments used by the SEC in the Ripple case can be more easily applied to Ethereum. 
> 
> Why does Ethereum get a free pass from creating a securities offering? Because Joe Lubin started the Brooklyn project before Ethereum even launched. There's multiple threads on this very sub that shows they sold it to more than just developers. I find the hypocrisy and corruption to be the biggest con argument for Ethereum. It's being chosen by the incumbent system as the only standard for web3 so far. I don't think Ethereum would be as highly valued or trusted if it didn't have carte blanche on illegal fundraising/ hosting tens of thousands of illegal securities offerings. 
> 
> The market needs to be a level playing field and right now it's heavily tilted towards Ethereum because of financial interests of early promoters, conflicts of interests from US regulators and their financial interests in Ethereum.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

Some pedentic nerd and bitcoin maximalist could argue that 1 BTC = 1 BTC BUT if you don't know how much you'll need to put food on the table then BTC is not working as a currency. Yes inflation is lowering the value of Fiat BUT fiat doesn't see wild swings of + or -  30 % in most economies. 
> 
> While not being really MONEY I'd argue that Bitcoin doesn't WORK. To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account.

He envisions El Salvador becoming the ""Singapore of the Americas"" by attracting investment capital and immigration. Despite opposition from global entities like the IMF and World Bank, El Salvador remains committed to its pro-Bitcoin stance and has invested significant funds in Bitcoin since its adoption. The country is also leveraging its volcanic resources to power a Bitcoin mining startup called Volcano Energy. While there are concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, the Salvadoran government sees it as an opportunity to generate income and participate in the global economy.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))

> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability.

> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.

The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

"17jahld","k70qskw","Money, or more accurately, ""something that could be money"" is *constantly* being invented. 

Ultimately, folks who make shoes want to drink orange juice, and they do not want to be stuck trading their shoes only with folks who squeeze oranges AND who need shoes.  

So they want to exchange their shoes for something that (almost) everyone selling orange juice will take in settlement.   

Money is just an abstract concept for a ubiquitous settlement instrument.  It needs to fit a few criteria e.g. fungible, provable, portable, durable...    But it also has to have a few very important other features.

A really important feature of ""money"" is that when you go in search of orange juice (having sold your shoes), you are confident you'll find someone selling orange juice for whatever you traded for your shoes.  The more people around you use the same thing, the more useful it becomes.   

Another thing that is really really important is that when you exchange your shoes for whatever you are going to use as money that it preserves its value - at least as well as shoes preserve their value.   You don't want to exchange a pair of shoes for something only to find that the next day it's worth half a pair of shoes. 

Perversely, and counter-intuitively, you also don't want it to be increasing in value.   One would think that you want the value to increase... but it turns out that an asset that increases in value with time gets hoarded, and folks end up keeping it and wanting to trade other things. 

There are very few things on the planet that fit all the criteria.  So while we invent all kinds of things that *could be* money, ultimately, very few things actually become money.","jps_"

"17jahld","k6zsstg","Got to look at this a bit more reflected. Money was big stones in some places, sometimes even big stones that sunk to the ground of the ocean. Not easy to transport. 

Gold was also cumbersome to lug around. Hence people started to leave it with that one guy for safekeeping and got a receipt to pick it up again in case they need their “money”. But then somebody got the idea of “hey you know what, I keep my gold with the same guy, just give me your paper receipt, so that I can pick up _your_ gold - which is now mine - myself. Spare you a trip.” The idea caught on so there’s paper money now. 

The gist is “money” is what a lot of people believe in and use to transfer a notion of value. 

After paper money: electronic money. Terribly convenient, no need to calculate change, so it caught on. …but do people “believe in it”? Increasingly not everyone, hence the next evolution, electronic money, but in a way that people trust it. Cool that it can do other types of trust too. 

We are at the start of the next evolution of value transfer and this type of value includes “trust”, “verifyability”, even “zero knowledge proof”. It’s going to be a wild ride and humanity will have decades to go until we figure the thing out and then in a hundred or two hundred years it will be time for something else entirely…","kogmaa"

"17jahld","k70g78z","There's a lot you're missing historically, like that precious metals aren't the first form of currency by a long shot, but I'm going to skip over that in favor of pointing out the flaws related to your actual idea here...

Paper money/fiat is not ""credit"". Credit is a form of debt that denotes one person owes another person something for a past transactions. ""Fiat currency"" is money that's backed as legal tender by the force of law in a country.

The relative value of one national currency against another is determined by the demand for that currency from companies and nations that want to buy things from that country. The US Dollar became the default currency of international trade because the US economy is so large that US dollars had by far the largest international demand, so it's often easier to trade internationally in US Dollars and then each party converts some part of them to whatever currency they actually need.

Crypto tokens are in no way related to ""shares of AI labor"", because there's zero connection between the tokens and any kind of AI system, nor is there a good way to make that happen. You can't simply replace hashing algorithms with AI calculations because those calculations don't have one verifiable answer, and the whole thing with Crypto is that the answer you get has to be relatively hard to arrive at but very easy to verify. That's literally how paired key cryptography, where Crypto Currency gets the ""Crypto"" from, works.

> I think there's one more way to invent money online. Decentralized credit. I've seen a few implementations. And thought of a few. It seems like individual tallies is what it will eventually come down to for most things because that's the most efficient.

I want to specifically address this, because it's been tried and it *does not work*. This sort of system is, in fact, the whole reason that money comes about even in small isolated communities. The classic example is where if you sell Oranges and I sell Apples, and I want Oranges but you don't want Apples, then I need to find a third person who wants Apples and also has something you want, or I need to essentially buy the item on credit until I can get something you want or you want Apples. The problem with this, even in any kind of digital space, is that unwinding this sort of ""decentralized credit"" system is impossible to do in a way that's more fair than just using existing money/credit systems. Unless you're making the ""credit"" notes for each individual fungible, in which case congrats you've just re-invented the credit card but in a more wasteful and messy form.","AvatarOfMomus"

"17jahld","k701235","I think you need to go back and study history, since money was originally representative only, as it is now. Even when coins were first minted it wasn't about the value of the gold, coins were just a way of tokenizing money in a way that was harder to forge (than for example, using shiny stones). The gold standard for currency was only about for a relative short period of time in the history of money, and for the most part makes no sense as it penalizes nations that don't hold their wealth in gold.

Similarly bitcoin is only representative as it holds no intrinsic value. Bitcoin isn't used for anything else, unlike gold where it's a commodity used in various products, and so bitcoin is just a token to which we assign a value.","PsychoVagabondX"

The more quickly you accept that almost all of it is an illegal securities market conducted via offshore regulatory arbitrage from investors, developers (i.e. issuers) via obscure legal wrappers, the better you'll sleep everyday instead of being getting wrapped up in their libertarian delusions.

""Zero-knowledge proof, trustless & decentralization"" are technology attributes, these are not socio-economic attributes ingrained in your society. Crypto has caused more harm in terms of accelerationism towards on-chain CBDC's and total surveillance on-chain finance than inherently give the power/privacy back to the people.

"17jahld","k72599i","A small group of human beings can live together without using a form of currency among each other(think a family or a tribe) because they know and trust each other. This was how humans lived a long time ago in small tribes when there were much less people around. 

The problem starts when groups of humans get too big and you can't know everybody, so you cannot trust everybody. This is where you need a hierarchical structure where a select group of people manage society and you need some form taxation to provide services for the greater good such as law enforcement.

If a state cannot manage its own currency as is the case with gold or bitcoin it will eventually run out of it and turn to chaos because they can no longer pay people to enforce the law.

With fiat money you eventually run into the same problem, you need to keep printing because if you don't you will run out of money(just like with bitcoin or gold) but as you print everybody becomes increasingly poorer and when the wealth gap becomes too large things will also turn to chaos.","Rough_Data_6015"
"17jahld","k7261pp","Unless the current monetary system is causing issues to everyday people in a way that they can perceive AND identify the cause of, I doubt decentralized electronic money (i.e. crypto) will be as widespread as some people on this sub pretend it will be.

Concern about inflation isn't alleviated by crypto, the crash when the FED started upping interest rates has clearly demonstrated that. How does the average person actually benefit from ""truly owning their money""? As long as they can use the money in their bank account for everyday purchases, ""actually OWNING"" their money isn't valuable enough to adopt cryptocurrencies.

Why use crypto when I can pay for anything by tapping my phone on a terminal irl or use my browser's built-in autofill to pay for stuff online? No need to wait for confirmations, no complicated address to copy and paste, no need to worry about being hacked/scammed + recourses (e.g. refunds, consumer protection laws, etc.) in case it does happen?

The current system is like a brand new road, basically frictionless, and crypto is like a dirt road in Ukraine in comparison.

Concerning anonymity, algorithms tracking people and shamelessly serving them content/ads relevant to their interests has shown that anonymity, partial or total, isn't actually valued by normal people unless they actually feel uncomfortable about it. They might feel uncomfortable thinking about algorithms, but since the ""harm"" isn't perceivable, and the benefits are (e.g. highly curated YouTube homepage), most people just don't think about it.

I guess there are SOME benefits to developing countries, but how is an average person from a random developing country supposed to learn about it and access the tools to use it when an average Westerner can't if they're not motivated (e.g. free money)?

I'm not a hater of cryptos, I use some myself but it's mainly for niche interests most people won't ever interact with.

"17jahld","k72r7ob","You make some interesting points about the evolution of money and how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and others represent new iterations of ""inventing"" money in the digital realm. A few thoughts on your perspective:  
You're right that early commodity monies like gold served the purposes of money well for physical transactions, but had limitations like bulk and transport.  
The abstraction of money into fiat currency and digital credits issued by centralized authorities was another innovation, with its own tradeoffs.  
Bitcoin's breakthrough was using cryptography and blockchain to create decentralized, digital scarcity and enable online peer-to-peer hard money transfers.  
Additional cryptocurrency projects have further innovated on attributes like privacy (Monero) and programmability (Ethereum).  
I think you make a great point about decentralized credit still being a largely unexplored area in crypto. Smart contract platforms are opening the door to peer-to-peer credit networks without centralized intermediaries. This could be a hugely impactful innovation.  
Overall, cryptocurrencies represent a paradigm shift in how we conceive of and use money in the digital age. There are likely more innovations to come that make money more open, global, and tailored to emerging digital economies. It's an exciting space to watch.  
You summarize the evolution very insightfully. Cryptocurrencies have come a long way in a short time, but still seem to be just at the beginning stages of their potential.","Crypto__Sapien"

This goes back to the part I wrote ""Perversely, and counter-intuitively, you also don't want [money] to be increasing in value.""   

TL;DR It turns out that you want money to be decreasing slightly in value over time.   

A lot of folks have a wrongheaded view of money.  They don't realize that it's just a temporary substitute for shoes and orange juice.  You aren't supposed to hold it.  You are supposed to exchange it soon after you get it.  It's designed, like cars and cellphones, to wear out.  To discourage people from holding on to it forever.   

There is a reason for that. The US dollar is a claim on things. Let's say 100 million people each hold one dollar.    That would be 100 million claims on things.   Theoretically, the US government would have to have 100 million of those things sitting around, just in case everyone wakes up one day and says ""here's my dollar, I want one of those things.""

In crypto parlance, the US needs to show its creditors ""proof of reserves"".

If the US$ was steady in value, or worse, increasing, there would be no reason for people to invest in productive assets.  They'd just pile dollars into their collective sock drawers, and one day return them when they have to pay a fortune in medical expenses to stay alive one more day.  And to keep its end of the bargain, the US government would have to keep huge amounts of liquid (transferrable) assets around, representing all the money in all the sock drawers.   They can't invest as much in long-lived assets because it sucks to be half way through building a bridge to have a crowd show up asking for their share of the bridge back.  Since you can't take your share of a bridge and have the bridge still function, nobody would accept it in the US ""proof of reserves"".  

That would be like Tether holding a loan to FTX and adding that to its proof of reserves.

Since we want bridges and we don't want them to fall down because pieces missing, we don't want hoarding.  Thus we don't want our money to be increasing or even constant in value.

To disincentivize hoarding, the government sets things up so that a year from now a hundred dollars is worth 93 things, and a year later 86 things, and so on.  If 100 million people each stuff a dollar in sock drawers for 30 years, then the government can issue $100M in cash (and take $100M in return), use $80M to build a bridge, use $20M to pay off debt, and get to keep the bridge for its useful life, and be ahead of the game.

Now, we don't want things to go too far in the other direction, where today a Bolivar buys 100 things and tomorrow it buys 10 things.   That's great if you borrowed Bolivars, bought an oil well from Venezuelans, and can now pay the loan back with a few drips of oil while refining the rest of it to fill your gas-guzzlers.  That works to the benefit of foreigners who want to rob a nation of its resources by ""borrowing"" from the nation.   But it doesn't work if you are the people, because nobody wants to lend you (plural) anything.  The majority of people in the US would be homeless if not for residential mortgages.  Rapid currency inflation is a bad thing.

Keeping a currency in the narrow range of some inflation but not too much is a very tricky art.  But it's not a bad thing that the US dollar loses value slightly.  The whole world benefits, actually. 

Because if instead of putting dollars in a sock drawer when you get them,  you use them to buy a few square feet of garden, a little bit at a time (or pay off a mortgage on a larger plot of garden), sooner or later you can feed yourself, your neighbours, or even a small village.  And you can live off whatever you sell your excess produce for.   Putting capital into productive applications is the path to wealth over the long term. 

A lot of people who are wrestling with debt and just beginning to earn more in income than it costs them to live and service their debt do not understand this.  They see money gradually accumulating in the bank as an asset.  It is... but it's only a short-term asset.   Wealth is not built by ""savings"".  It is built by ""investment"", and there's a world of difference.","jps_"

Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # CONs
> 
> **Early Buyers have the Higher Ground.**
> 
> * Those who bought BTC in it's early years have a great advantage over the recent ones. One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**
> 
> * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services. ([5](https://web.archive.org/web/20140325214514/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-08/did-the-sec-just-validate-bitcoin-no-), [6](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2012/09/29/monetarists-anonymous), [7](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace), [8](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-criticizes-bitcoin.html), [9](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/stiglitz-roubini-and-rogoff-lead-joint-attack-on-bitcoin-20180709))
> 
> **It still Affects the Environment**
> 
> * Bitcoin accounts 0.1% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year. The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.
> 
> **The Requirement of Being Responsible and Disciplined**
> 
> * The constant triple-checking of addresses making sure that it's yours and not some dead end address or the fact that you need to keep your passphrase safe physically and never keep them in any device connected to the internet as to avoid any possible hacks/scams. The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

Despite that, we should strive to use the current US dominance to curb rogue states into the world order. 
> 
> The current war in Ukraine is a demonstration of the world order crumbling to maintain itself. I'd argue, the rise of cryptocurrencies may be a part of this crumbling. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that, Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar would usher a chaotic age of international relation.

Some pedentic nerd and bitcoin maximalist could argue that 1 BTC = 1 BTC BUT if you don't know how much you'll need to put food on the table then BTC is not working as a currency. Yes inflation is lowering the value of Fiat BUT fiat doesn't see wild swings of + or -  30 % in most economies.

To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.

The maths problem becomes harder when more people are mining so that mining takes a fixed amount of time according to a timeline known to everyone. In order to respect this timeline, mining rewards are halved every few years.

> Since anyone who wants to validate transactions is forced to complete a very hard math problem (which becomes harder the more people are mining), no one can cheat in new transactions.

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.

What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity.

Im sure if you looked around you would see a bunch of theories. What I leave you with is what Satoshi said…in an email to Mike Hearn.

Anyway, what matters is for you to read their response when Hearn asked…what up with that number and interval?

Hi Mike,
Sun, Apr 12, 2009 at 10:44 PM


I'm glad to answer any questions you have. If I get time, I ought to write a FAQ to supplement the paper.


There is only one global chain.
The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.


By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.


I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don't. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.


Eventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards. For now, it's nice that anyone with a PC can play without worrying about what video card they have, and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. More computers are shipping with fairly decent PUs these days, so maybe later we'll transition to that.


A key aspect of Bitcoin is that the security of the network grows as the size of the network and the amount of value that needs to be protected grows. The down side is that it's vulnerable at the beginning when it's small, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller than the amount of effort required to steal it. If someone has other motives to prove a point, they'll just be proving a point I already concede.

My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. 

If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.

Ripple is interesting in that it's the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.

"17ict4z","k6wk2ww","Note:

The biggest mental mountain doubters need to climb is to accept this fact: value is subjective.

There is no Lord of Value. There never has been. 

If each of you were given 1m and told to spend it on anything except an asset or investment vehicle we would see this in action. 

Some would buy a boat. Some would buy a bunch of chocolate boats and buy new furniture. Some would buy watches (and scream it’s not an investment, they just like the movement). Some would buy nothing physical and spend the money on experiences and great food.

We all decide how to weight “value.” There is no final arbiter of Value.

You may never comprehend why someone would spend 40k on a gun skin in CSGO. No utility in the game. Skins are nothing more then pretty pixels. But there are many people who would jump at the chance to spend that kind of money on skins. We know this. Because they do so each day.

What people mean when they say bitcoin or crypto has no intrinsic value is, “I hold the value of the US Dollar to such a degree that all I see you doing is burning it for magic internet money.”

Cool.

You do you. 

These same people might not sit back and wonder why my first apt in San Francisco (Bush St, 1993-94) was $500 a month. To this cohort what has changed is the cost of rent in major cities. They don’t stop and consider that this highly valuable fiat currency they hold in such regard has lost so much buying power that my old rent seems “cheap.”

Prices have not sky rocketed. The buying power of fiat has been debased…inflated away.

And it will continue to do so…The Fed is obsessed with making sure inflation returns to 2% a year. Sit with that. They don’t want deflation. They don’t want “cheaper prices.” The Fed simply wants to slow the debasement of the dollar to 2%

What doubters don’t yet grasp is the value we place in bitcoin is scarcity. The value we place in other cryptocurrencies is that their exchange value will increase far more then the eroding buying power of fiat. (The current value of 1 ETH to the <insert fiat amount> today will be far more in a decade then simply holding the same current value in fiat, treasuries (including the compounding real yield) stocks, fine art, or Pokémon cards, etc.

That’s it. It is inevitable that some new Bretton Woods agreement or new world reserve currency will supplant the dollar.  But they will continue to save and spend and complain about “rising prices” as so many other people have done as their fiat/money was inflated away into oblivion.","Morning_Star_Ritual"

In 1987, the stock market crashed so hard that they introduced something called a 'circuit breaker' which prevents people from selling when a stock crashes too much. 

in 2021, Gamestop stock pumped so hard that Robinhood only made it possible for people to sell, setting a precedent to prevent people from buying when a stock pumps too much.   


No matter what happens in crypto, I will always be able to buy and sell.

And it requires a substantial input of effort to mine those metals — millions of dollars in equipment, labor, and energy costs. 

The BTC network requires an enormous amount of computing hardware and energy. That has intrinsic value. BTC is backed by those assets and the labor of those who maintain the network. And there are only two ways to get it: Acquire the computing power and energy to mine it yourself or pay someone who already did. That’s it.

"17ict4z","k6v061g","As a foundational concept, every network/protocol acts as its own economy.

Within these economies, stakeholders are paid/rewarded in the economies' native currency to incentivize behavior — those payments are made via transaction fees paid by users and applications that use the network; these users purchase this native cryptocurrency on an exchange (creating market demand for the native currency, effectively increasing its “intrinsic value”).

On Ethereum, for example, these two stakeholders are paid in $ETH to support the network:

- Validators (node operators)
- Stakers of $eth

When transaction fees are paid by users/applications, they go to validators, and a smaller % goes to those staking $eth to said validators  — with enough transactions on the network (as they have today), it becomes economically viable to run validators as a business and/or stake $eth to ensure the security of the network.

As these stakeholders accumulate rewards/payment, they can go to an exchange to sell $ETH for USD (or another currency) to pay for business operations — or they keep the $ETH and use it to directly pay for business operations (depending on what they're buying).

The value of $ETH is dependent on the ""GDP"" (attempting to keep the theme of ""economies"" here) of the network — the more applications, ecosystem, and tokenized value (RWAs, crypto assets, etc.) that exists on a network, the greater the market value of its native currency, because there is greater demand to purchase it from exchanges to power usage. Valuing a native currency is difficult, but standards are emerging.

Other Layer 1 and Layer 2 PoS networks utilize this same framework — however, most have the addition of a ""treasury account"". A small percentage of transaction fees are paid to the network's treasury, which is utilized to pay for business operations to support the network (marketing, engineering, product, etc.) — my understanding is that Ethereum community has considered including this, but nothing has been decided (uncertain here).

Revenue, therefore, is based on the total aggregate value of transaction fees being paid by users to utilize these networks and is a key metric tracked by Analysts in the space. One of these reports can be found here, as an example: https://messari.io/report/state-of-l1s-q1-2023

How sellable is (to fiat) is gold. How much time & effort vs crypto?  
How scarce? Nobody can tell.  


>Now we can argue on some level that gold is intrinsically valuable. The scarcity is what drives the value.

Golds intrinsic value does not stem from its use cases imo. Electronics & dentistry have little demand & the jewelry use case is an extension of golds store of value proposition. However the gold already minded far exceeds the industrial demand in such way that if gold mining stopped completely, gold holders could supply the industrial demand for over 100 years.

As medium of exchange gold has not become the most adopted tool. That is precisely because of its lack in portability & divisibility. Crypto has not yet achieved great adoption but it overcomes both of these issues.","MichaelAischmann"

It's not just scarcity though, otherwise anything scarce would be valuable. It's because it's sought after for a range of uses. Even if you argue that blockchain technology is useful, bitcoin itself doesn't have a used beyond being a measure of quantity, which makes it more like fiat than gold. Importantly though, if all bitcoin disappeared today the majority of people affected would be those who had bought and held bitcoin.

>And like gold, it is highly scarce. The supply has been programmatically predetermined to be only 21 million bitcoin, with the final fraction of bitcoin to be mined in 2140.

This is only programming though, it can be changed. And ill likelihood it will be, because once miners are relying almost exclusively on fees to pay them, the fees would need to be outrageously high for it to be worthwhile, so I expect at some point down the line for the supply cap to be moved.

>The US is in trillions of dollars of debt that cannot be paid off anytime soon.

This doesn't really mean much. People like to think of this as if they were in trillions of debt but national debt doesn't really have the same impact as personal debt. It certainly needs to be controlled but looked at as a percentage of GDP rather than raw numbers it's a long way from unrecoverable.

>The money supply has been astronomically inflated, leading to a dramatic devaluing of the dollar and a cost-of-living crisis.

Blaming the cost-of-living crisis on the money supply is lazy. There are numerous factors of which increase in money supply is a minor one.

>In the eventuality of the dollar collapsing

Enough GAINS are bought and between traders losing and GAINS being sold, the ETH vault is well funded again.

The intrinsic value of crypto is that it is a scarce digital asset.  We frankly don't yet know what to do with one of these things.  Mostly because we've had millions of years to evolve notions of possession of things we can eat or wear, and over that time come up with the social concepts of possession and usefulness, to which we attach value. 

Crypto is relatively new on the scale of social evolution, so we don't yet understand its value (and it might turn out to be as valuable as Carbon, which is to say ranging from not very to quite a lot).

But one thing we know for sure is that it is an asset and therefore it has non-zero value. 

Because it is an asset, with non-zero value, a key aspect of its intrinsic value is to settle debt obligations.   As long as you and your counterparty both accept that an asset has A value (whatever that is), you can settle a debt between you by exchanging an amount of that asset equal in value to that debt.  Settling debts is critical to commerce, which has huge social value. 

Crypto has several useful attributes when it comes to exchange.  You can exchange any arbitrary amount at once.  You can carry an arbitrary amount with the same effort.  The latency of exchange is the same no matter the distance between you and your counterparty.  It does not decay or rot.   And other than the protocol and its operations (which you can both measure and trust because math), you and your counterparty do not need to trust a third party.  

This means that as long as there is enough of it, and it is widely enough accepted so that you and your counterparty are both able to arrive at a mutually agreeable value, you and your counterparties can use it to settle obligations. 

This is the intrinsic value of crypto. 

Now... if we assume it is ubiquitously available to all persons, then as long as I can rent crypto from someone, transfer it to my counterparty, and my counterparty can return the crypto to that someone... we can conduct business.    One or both of us will pay the rent.  That's how all intermediated commerce works. 

Whoever holds crypto can rent it out, and earn a passive income from that rent.  Someone at this stage invariably thinks about BTC, and then thinks ""wow... there's only 24 million of them, they are going to be worth *a lot*...""

Probably, yes.  But how much is ""a lot""?   

There are currently about 21 million BTC.   If we assume that about 10% of these are in flow and the rest are in cold storage waiting for value to fully mature, then that's 2 million in flow.   If we assume transactions take about 6 blocks to settle perfectly, then I can rent whatever amount I need for three hours:  one to settle in my account, one to transfer to my counterparty's account, and one to settle back to the renter's account.  

So we can turn 2.1 million every 3 hours, or about 17 million per day, or about 6 billion per year.   Global flows of commerce were about 25 trillion in 2022.  Which means that we could settle all of the world's commerce with 10% of BTC in flow if each one is worth around $4000, round that up to $5000.   It's still a lot less than the current price of BTC.

Now... admittedly not all exchanges are for value.   All the money that gets spent in a casino does not really change the number of casino chips, it just changes who owns them.  The current price of BTC supports a 6:1 gambling/value ratio, which isn't that high.

But... we're only talking 10% in flow and BTC is not the only crypto out there.  XRP hopes to settle banking transactions.  Monero hopes to be untraceable money...  And there's all this fiat floating around.   

One thing Fiat has going for it is what is called ""legal tender"", which means that of all the things your local counterparty might accept as an asset to settle debts, one of them *must* be fiat.  If someone refuses to accept fiat, you don't have to pay the debt.  Someone is free to refuse to accept crypto.  Thus, you are free to settle debts in any currency your counterparty will accept, but you might have to spend a while finding a landlord who will accept a flock of chickens (or crypto) in return for this month's rent.  Ubiquity is such an overwhelming advantage in local commerce that when we factor in the fraction of global commerce that is actually local, we've got more than enough BTC to handle the rest.  

None of this has anything to do with ""halvening"", or supply shock.  It all has to do with an emerging ecosystem that hasn't shaken out yet.  It's a complete speculative free-for-all.  And people are inventing reasons for their favourite crypto in a race they think is ""winner take all"".

I don't know if people can really visualize this, but a 1 gram coin is extremely small.  Even diluted, the smallest denomination is basically worth a little more than a $20 bill.  If we actually used gold as a currency You wouldn't be able to buy a cup of coffee or chips or a gallon of milk with your money, This makes physical gold impractical for everyday use.  Furthermore, if gold were accepted as a legal tender its value could easily increase by 10x.  This means that the smallest accepted denomination would be $260 (tho this would likely be even higher).

We can largely substitute finance analogies with information theory when discussing cryptographic technologies: tokens and trading are specific kinds of *data*, but they only become *information* if they present a coherent view of the world.

So, Bitcoin has some long-term stability because the chain itself is a historical artifact. But yesterday's airdropped meme chain doesn't have any legacy, so it has flimsy, purely speculative value.

And what harms a chain lies in any kind of information loss or corruption; forks, double transactions, and so on. Scams absolutely are part of this; a scam lowers the quality of information by non-consensually reassigning credit. An inefficent chain is less valuable: it impedes the ability to accumulate information. A chain that sacrifices trust in its consensus is also less valuable. Avoiding these pitfalls disappoints speculators in the short term, because they would like to trade on it, but it creates groundwork for later.

At the far end of a transaction is the real work: ""I expect this thing to be done because we traded."" When speculation fails it never gets there. But we use speculative activity to allow new things to be tried, and markets enable individuals to do a lot of that, every day.

The value of money lies purely within the monetary premium rather than the industry value. 

Copper and steel have higher utility than gold, given their use in industry. But they are poor monies because it's extremely easy to make more of it at a low cost. 

The new supply would rapidly dilute old supply if we used those metals as money instead. 

Historically, you can see the story repeating, whether in the Rai stones of the Yap people or the glass beads of West Africa.

The dilution rate is low when the stock to flow ratio is very high. The natural rarity of gold and silver made them good monies. Whilst silver is worse is stock to flow, it is more divisible than gold.

The secret to a good money isn't ornamental value or industry value. It is the stock to flow.","RatherCynical"

Copper is actually a better conductor than gold. Gold is just used sometimes because it doesn't corrode and is more malleable. If gold was cheaper it wouldn't replace copper because copper is better for what its used for.

I would guess that about 99% of golds value comes from demand for extrinsic value as money or jewelry. Bitcoin is pretty much the same. It does have some non-zero intrinsic value as highly available, global, public database. But most of its value is through its utility as money. 

But money has a very real utility value, we just usually define that as not being ""intrinsic"" to the underlying commodity implementing it.","Squezeplay"
"17ict4z","k6u2w6l","Much of the value comes from there being a for-public-use data server (the ledger) with certain useful security/anti-fraud guarantees built into the structure.

If people want to write a lot of data to the ledger, the price goes up due to competition for space. If the world doesn't care so much, the price goes down, and it becomes cheaper to write to.

The security guarantees the parent network offers can be used to provide security for other decentralized networks at a fraction of a fraction of the parent network's infrastructure, power, and general bringup costs. Those networks may be entirely non-financial in nature -- maybe being used to validate books or other documents hosted on a decentralized library setup. Or maybe for offering globally-usable identity services that aren't controlled by any one government or corporation.

One existing example are the ION identity nodes (open source, but coded by Microsoft engineers) that provide infrastructure for a decentralized network that can be used to provide identity guarantees -- say a driver's license issued in Canada that could be instantly verified as a non-forgery in Germany for a car rental.

Essentially, the BTC network is being used to store security checkpoints for an un-permissioned identity system no one person or company controls -- with every character of that checkpoint having been paid for in BTC sent to the miners as a TX fee.

>if I were to wave my magic wand and deposit 21mm Bitcoin into my wallet (somehow officially and all above board on the ledger) would those coins have any value

If you run a service, or know of an entity that depends on writing data to the public ledger for security guarantees (like the Microsoft-created ION nodes currently do, or any of the layer-2 services do), then yes, that BTC still has some use (therefore value) outside of just trading it from A to B.

As you write data to the ledger, you'll be forced to give your BTC to miners who can sell if back to you (since your BTC will *eventually* run out as you exchange it for data writes), or they can use it themselves, or sell it to anyone else who wants to write data to the ledger in the future.","Johnny_SkullTek"

"17ict4z","k6ubcwq","Gold has intrinsic value, because it has utility and can solve everyday problem.

Ask yourself this, what intrinsic value does a software have? Or a service, or a technology? Even if it's digital.

Crypto has all of the above. Bitcoin's blockchain itself offers several services and solutions. It offers security services, same as a security firm would offer. It offers a database for transactions. It offers a worldwide network of authentication services and verification of transactions and proof of funds. It offers decentralization in ways similar services are unable to.

And once you go into other cryptos like ETH, then there's a wider array of utility and problem solving.

All services that on their own, if a company offered those services, we would never question their value.

Just like any tech, if you offer a services and solve a problem, that's the core of your utility and intrinsic value.

Even if something is digital, just like gold it still offers utility, even if you remove the element of speculation.

Now ask yourself this: Does it matter what the price of Bitcoin is for the tech side? Is $200, $2,000, or $20,000, changing anything about its technology or utility?

The fact that this magic wand exists makes money invaluable, just like bitcoin would be too. And you're right, gold would remain valuable as a it a raw material that is useful for many things. So your analogy breaks bitcoin, yes. But would also break fiat money or traditional banking.

Fiat money and bitcoin are both part of a system based on trust, and it's the trust in the system that makes them valuable. Cryptocurrencies are valuable because it's another way to deal with this trust needed in the transaction of value, but this time circumnavigating the middle man like a central bank.","avocado_lover69"

Sure they would still have value. Plenty of people would beg you to sell them some BTC.

Because they want or need to transact freely where banks or govs don't let them. You owning all Bitcoin might create a liquidity crisis and make price discovery harder.. but still, you and potential buyers could still come up with a price.

Or they'd value it because their fiat currency goes down the drain and they still believe in a worldwide decentralized currency to be more stable. The underlying blockchain technology and its security would still provide value, independent of the distribution of coins (all in one wallet). Note that this only holds for PoW coins. PoS coins might be screwed.

Or because they want to own a piece of history or just because they want to collect something that's... scarce.

"17ict4z","k6xg202","I hear this take a lot but I think it’s fundamentally  flawed in a few ways. If you take the market value of the “intrinsically valuable” properties of gold (conductivity, etc.) you don’t get the price that it trades at. Because, like people have said, there are cheaper things that can do it better.

So, does that mean that gold is in a bubble? Because it’s highly overvalued relative to it’s properties? Not necessarily, because it’s a reliable store of value for all the reasons mentioned above.

But, imo, Bitcoin is more than just a store of value or digital gold. If you want to talk about “intrinsic value”, I think there are a lot of properties about Bitcoin that make it incredibly valuable. For example: permissionless, anonymous, cryptographically secure consensus as a means to confer property rights. Never before in history have human beings been able to decide on property rights without relying on a centralized authority to intermediate and enforce those rights, until Bitcoin was invented.

Wars have been fought, nations have been built and destroyed, and the very idea of numbers was invented all to enforce property rights. The mathematics behind Bitcoin is the first time in history we don’t need to use force, but rather economic incentives, to enforce ownership. Bitcoin does this for money, while Ethereum and other chains take this a step further and do it for software. The scale and significance of this in my mind is era-defining, but we’re all too caught up around the number going up to consider the implications of this. 

Bitcoin is not a way to make money. Bitcoin is a an alternative to human coordination, and money is just one of the mediums upon which we need to coordinate.","jiniba"

Nothing else has much of a hope of catching up and replacing it because Bitcoin only has to continue to do what it already does to continue winning. It was the first to succeed and will always have that mantle. Other networks may have traffic and different use cases—but store of value, digital scarcity… by definition there can be only one winner there. The decentralized world already made up its mind.

"17ict4z","k7b0ocu","Transaction fees will should go down in sat value over time as Bitcoin rises in value but could potentially go up in fiat terms. If that happens, sending BTC will be more costly, potentially pricing out the poor layer 1 main chain. Of course, the value of the Bitcoin network will have gone way up by that point. It’s all balanced supply and demand of block space. Now, it’s possible that people could collude to fill the network with transactions (ordinals anyone?), upping the fees to intentionally price out the poor, but 1) what would be the point and 2) they would have to pay to do that, bringing more value to the network by increasing miner revenue. Sure, it could get costly one day in fiat terms, but if you stack enough that won’t be a problem, and people buying at that point will probably be better off transacting on layer 2+’s instead of on chain for their very reason. 


In short, the fees to transact will probably be no higher than today in sat value so just be sure to have enough sats in any given address to make your future transaction(s) worth it. Some people send $5 a day or whatever to their hard wallets, using a new address each time. Those people should probably be pooling their deposits to their hard wallet instead. There are also ways to recombine it by sending a transaction to yourself from all the many addresses you might have (utxo management), since each address will have its own fee added to the total transaction fee. That’s about as complicated as it gets imo when it comes to this stuff. Just something to be aware of. No one likes excessive fees.","Into-the-Beyond"

Blocks get mined and transactions set with them. Not all blocks get filled when miners find the hash answers more quickly than average from time to time. I don’t track this stuff but I know this was true in the past anyway. As the network does get more congested, prices will go up to get included in the finite space of the block, that’s just how it works.

No one is likely to ever control a large enough portion of the hash rate to restrict anyone as long as they offer a high enough bid to be included. Maybe some country in the future restricts every node in their territory to not add blocks from restricted addresses, but if someone from outside of that territory wins they can still add their block in the normal manner of who will pay them the most.

The key point and most important point here is “indistinguishable from any other part”. 

Bitcoin is absolutely distinguishable from one BTC to another BTC. Bitcoin can be tainted. If it’s tainted it’s stuck with that forever! This is a fact!

Crypto is just a public ledger, which is literally the same thing as a private ledger (database), but trustless... Kinda.

Go look at price per operation of a smart contract vs AWS to see what I mean.

As to the car analogy you're missing my point entirely. 
For the sake of keeping a car analogy, imagine if you had for instance a Tesla (your wallet) that had to remain parked on public streets (the ledger).  Enron Mushmouth decides to switch from Nazi loving to commie and updates cars to not require keys.  Anyone can take your car at any time with zero difficulty.  Your ownership of the vehicle becomes irrelevant and you couldn't sell it even if you tried because the new owner would have the same problem of not being able to restrict access to it.

Even without the value going up, the point will be that it doesn’t go down on average and that will make it a valuable tool even then for preserving whatever wealth people put into it. It’s not about the gains, it’s about the certainty and scarcity. It’s about Bitcoin being a bucket that’s not riddled with holes like every other financial vehicles. Now, today, it’s definitely also a speculative asset that I recognize must increase much in value before it reached the point of full adoption. In that way it is both things for me.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation.

If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...

> 
> Disclaimer: I own bitcoin, and use it as a way to invest my money, although I do not move money on the lightning network!
>   
> 
>   
> The lightning network is a peer-to-peer network that is built upon bitcoin. The lightning network basically uses bitcoin to give cheap and fast transactions for bitcoin. Something interesting to me that basically, no one talks about is that the lightning network is customizable towards multiple coins… Litecoin is the second coin that supports the lightning network. Although I believe this is pretty useless, (litecoin fees are already pretty low) it doesn’t remove the fact that a $0.50\~ transaction fee can become near $0. Some say the transaction fee is “about as large as an atom”. The transaction speeds of the Lightning network is just simply not important, it’s fast enough so that if the whole world were using the LN network we may have a few seconds of delay in any given transaction. The fees also are about nothing, $0. To be honest, I am excited over this network, it allows not only anonymity, feeless transactions, scalability, but a solution to a foundation bitcoin built, a foundation that became a problem in itself for its low tps, bad fees, and scalability.
>   
> 
>   
> The lightning network to work basically sets up a channel that connects the network from the sender and receiver. The lightning networks uses multi-signature transactions to confirm a lightning channel. Time locks are also used, which is a way to stop transactions from instantly being executed. Time locks are most commonly used when there’s a lot of demand for bitcoin transactions, and not enough blocks being confirmed. When a payment channel is opened, the multi-signature feature of bitcoin builds addresses that only allow those addresses to move money between each other if both signatures are confirmed. The lightning network includes the local and remote balances, the local balance is your balance, the remote is the other party involved. REFUNDS ACTUALLY EXIST ON LIGHTNING. They are limited in time, but they exist, reversible transactions exist. Refunds from what I know though are only used when a payment channel is set up and party A puts bitcoin into the channel, and party B ghosts party A. Usually, you need both parties to confirm a transaction (moving bitcoin from the payment channel back into the bitcoin network itself) but if party B ghosts party A for a few days, you can refund.
>   
> 
>   
> The transactions when completed should be boxed up and put into a block on the chain. If there are three or more parties then the transaction shows the first and last transaction “A pays B 5 btc, B pays C 5btc” the transaction on chain would be “A pays C 5 btc”. Unconfirmed transactions are also a life saver. Technically, you can send 5 btc to party B and party B never accepts the transaction, and party A never refunds it. Party B can at any time confirm the transaction then and own the bitcoin. I can’t wait to see how people will use this feature to basically just stop confirming transactions on the blockchain, but still, have bitcoin moving around. Full anonymity. Bitcoin has a limited amount of transactions that can fit inside a block, this is why you pay higher when more people want to move Bitcoin around, more demand, limited supply, and unlike other side chains like polygon on ethereum the lightning network is, well, a network, not a chain.

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized.

Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.

One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)).

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)).

The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.

"17hzsbf","k6t7ujx","Yet that's the top comment here? Wtf at the state of this sub. I hope these folks have $5 invested to match the amount of time they've thought about Bitcoin.

I've tried to raise flags about how 2 pools could 51% Bitcoin today, which wasn't conceivable for over a decade prior. Then inevitably maxis in here will argue it doesn't matter if there was even just 1 pool with 100% the hashrate. May as well let JPMorgan handle the ledger, at that point.

Cypherpunks used to post on here. I can't believe it now.

""Difficulty adjustment is an amazing thing."" yeah.. no, it's not. It means the chain gets exponentially cheaper and easier to break and control over time as decentralization incentives are fleeting.

"17hzsbf","k6thg7e","There is even a mathematical advantage. Very slim, but it is there. A coordinated pool has better partitioning of hashes to check. They will never have to check the same potential solution twice. Two (or more) smaller actors can potentially “waste” resources checking the same hash.

"17hzsbf","k6tydwv","Miners run their own nodes buddy.

Nodes on an insecure chain are useless. Following any logic nodes follow the miners, not the other way around.

If I run a full copy of AWS that doesn't somehow put me in ""control"" of AWS, not when AWS broadcasts their own copies - anf AWS is who derives 100% of the security therefore all value.

A chain with 500,000 nodes and 2 miners next to a chain with 2 nodes and 500,000 miners(which means +500,000 full nodes). You think the first has higher security and the longest blockchain? Learn how POW works first then come back to me.

If nodes hold so much power, why didn’t China use their superior hash power to take control before their government banned mining? Why hasn’t there been a successful fork of Bitcoin? Why does the value held in the network continue to grow? 

Seems you don’t have an understanding of the incentive structure behind the entire network. But go on, keep looking at just one minuscule aspect to try and find a weakness. 

I’d like to throw out a wild guess and guess you’re waiting for the flippening? Lol","terp_studios"
"17hzsbf","k6uwunt","It will get exponentially easier to buy 51% of Bitcoin's POW over time due to halvings. It is a mathematical certainty.

Nodes are not part of POW - they're not getting paid for a reason - they don't dictate the longest blockchain which is the only valid/safe Bitcoin. There is no cost or limit to run a node, 1 individual can run many millions of nodes.

Why would China etc. spend $100M+ on a temporary attack, when in 10 halvings it will cost them under $1M? Why would China devalue their currency against Bitcoin, when Bitcoin algorithmically (exponentially) is devaluing its hashprice without anyone's help? China isn't stupid, they play the long game always.

**Take $100,000,000,000 and divide it in half 10-20 times, then remind yourself Bitcoin is only secured with ~$30M today.**

Halvings are massively fueling centralization (so called miner capitulation events, that we cheer on). The majority of miners are (law abiding) publically traded companies today, which only serves to reduce Bitcoin's attack surface more over time. *One day* Bitcoin won't be decentralized, after the hashprice is low enough or its industry is centralized in 1 region well enough, whichever happens first, while both are trending to happen with 100% certainty due to POW's incentives being temporary to begin with.. Nobody is doing a damn thing to prevent it, because maxis like yourself would rather sniff farts instead of realizing there's a flaw in this stupid *and new* ""SoV"" meme you've cooked up. Frankly anyone that cares has moved on by now.

If I was China and I wanted to attack Bitcoin I'd have memed SoV into existence, then watch as the hashprice falls to $0, then spend a fraction of a fraction of what I'd have spent to censor Bitcoin indefinitely otherwise... Maybe it's not coincidence that meme (HODL) is singlehandedly the most counter productive thing going for Bitcoin's long term decentralization.

>keep looking at just one minuscule aspect to try and find a weakness. 

A blockchain is literally as secure as its weakest link. It is so dumb people 'looking for weakness' in BTC is seen as weakness by you new-era fart sniffing maxis. People used to think 50 years out, plan for every attack, state level/G20 there are no limits, then build and build some more - repeat until attack happens, then repeat again until attack happens, etc. Now people just dgaf if Bitcoin lives or dies next time it's attacked, which is a damn shame because 1st grade math/logic says it's going to be cheaper therefore more likely to succeed in the future as hashrate (everything) naturally centralizes.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round. If this topic is active, submit an entry in r/CointestOfficial and earn Moons if you win. Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare ...
