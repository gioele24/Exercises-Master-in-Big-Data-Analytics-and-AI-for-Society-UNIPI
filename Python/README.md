All the exercises named 'Exercise_*' are my solutions to the exercises of the book 'The Coderâ€™s Apprentice: Learning Programming with Python 3' by Pieter Spronck.

The files named 'exercises*' contain both solutions to exercises from the same book above as well as to other exercises given during class.
